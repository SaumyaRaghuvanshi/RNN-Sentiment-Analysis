            "----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
            "Review 2: [Rating: 8] [Positive] This is a tough one, now I watched Seasons 1 - 4, I binged the living **** out of it, and I gotta say, I never thought I'd like this. I'm very happy that I caught this series just in time for next year. So this series is an 8/10 because it suffers from some incorrect scientific fiction. The other thing is that the characters in most cases are incredibly stupid, especially in season 4 where it's noticeable. The writers struggled with Seasons 3 - 4 because they forgot certain logic that was explained in S1 - 2. I can only hope they rewatch what they made for S5, because if it continues with the same writing from S4, then oh boy we have a Game of Thrones Situation coming. Anyway, the way this Series is composed with its cinematography characters and Cool and Fun Sci-fi, it's **** far.\n",

            "Review 4: [Rating: 5] [Mixed] Pretty decent TV show to watch. Season 2 and 3 were the lows of the show but it is an overall slightly above average TV show.\n",
            "----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
            "Review 5: [Rating: 6] [Mixed] Overall a decent show. I loved the first two seasons and season three was alright, but I feel like season four dropped off a little. The plot was a little more messy and there was too much going on. However, my chief complaint about this show is that it is not at all epilepsy-friendly. There are an egregious amount of flashing lights that made portions of the show literally unwatchable.\n",
            "----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
            "Review 6: [Rating: 4] [Mixed] Seasons 1 and 2 are great and make clever use of reference and homage, while maintaining their own identity. By the time Season 3 rolls around, there's plot recycling and homage is traded for straight up imitation. Season 4 seems to be more of the same there, in addition to some more ***pull plot elements. There's no way in my mind Season 5 could salvage this show after it jumped the shark hard in Season 3, so I give it 2/5 overall. I don't know if the fame went to the directors' heads or Netflix simply wanted M0AR, whatever the cost, but it went downhill far earlier than I anticipated.\n",

            "----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
            "Review 8: [Rating: 3] [Negative] A significant disappointment for me after all the hype the show generated. Only managed until the end of Season 2, when I realised I couldn't care less to watch the finale and that I had been done with the show for a while. Season 1 was good, but it wasn't mindblowing. At the end of the season I remember thinking that it had reached a satisfying-enough conclusion for me to bow out, but I decided to carry on. Season 2 just repeated a lot of the same storylines, the characters weren't going anywhere new, and I realised I'd made a mistake. This rarely happens to me with shows. Weird one, Season 1 just wasn't enough to justify a continuation.\n",

            "Review 9: [Rating: 0] [Negative] Don't you hate when Americans say Vietnam War was bad because their soldiers suffered, like the people those soldiers killed didn't even exist in the first place!? God, I hate American exceptionalism! Oh, wait! The show does acknowledge the people killed by Americans -- as \"commie ****\"! Nothing like dehumanization to ease your conscience...\n",
