10,"One of the best seasons I have ever seen. its filled with amazing moments,some of the most scariest Scenes I have ever seen and also one of the best villains yet in vecna.",Positive
8,"This is a tough one, now I watched Seasons 1 - 4, I binged the living **** out of it, and I gotta say, I never thought I'd like this. I'm very happy that I caught this series just in time for next year. So this series is an 8/10 because it suffers from some incorrect scientific fiction. The other thing is that the characters in most cases are incredibly stupid, especially in season 4 where it's noticeable. The writers struggled with Seasons 3 - 4 because they forgot certain logic that was explained in S1 - 2. I can only hope they rewatch what they made for S5, because if it continues with the same writing from S4, then oh boy we have a Game of Thrones Situation coming. Anyway, the way this Series is composed with its cinematography characters and Cool and Fun Sci-fi, it's **** far.",Positive

10,"I still have no idea how they do it, but somehow they manage to keep the series going and that each time it goes up a level more than the previous one, without a doubt it’s a good series that everyone should watch.",Positive
8,"Very good throughout, despite there being a few time where the plot falls flat or the scenes feel too long. Apart from that there are very likable characters and role models and great storytelling.",Positive
8,"Very nice tv show , so excited of 5 season, can't wait, actually one of my favorite tv show ever. 8,5/10 solid",Positive
9,"Is Stranger Things actually worth watching? Stranger things - it’s a science fiction horror drama. Moreover, it involves the topics such as love, friendship, school issues and so on. This TV series is about a group of teenagers who is trying to save their town by fighting horrific monsters. The plot is super unique, the scenes are thrilling and the character development is amazing. The directors, The Duffer Brothers, have come up with a brilliant idea for the series. They have managed to create a TV show for people of all ages. The Stranger things series has four seasons. The fifth one will come out at the end of 2025 year. Each season consists of 8-11 episodes. The actors’ cast has been selected correctly. Every actor suits its character. That helps you to immerse yourself in the theme of the series. The single disadvantage is about the episode release time. Fans always have to wait about 2-3 years to watch a new season. It’s too long, because with the passage of time, you start to forget last episodes, so you have to rewatch the TV show to recall the details in your memory. In general, it’s the best way to spend your free time with pleasure watching something interesting. Try to offer it to your family and friends. They’ll like your idea.",Positive
8,Stranger things is a good show for me and I can't wait for the fifth season,Positive
7,It's very good for the first few seasons after that I kinda feel like it over stays It's welcome,Positive
10,"A series that contains everything to be good, script, soundtrack that fits perfectly at the right moments, charismatic characters, actors who were born to play their roles and a wonderful direction, one of the greatest series ever made in humanity and that marked and will mark many people still.",Positive
10,"""Stranger Things"" is a thrilling nostalgia trip for anyone who grew up in the 80s. The show's homage to classics like A Nightmare on Elm Street and Aliens is a delightful treat for fans of that era. The authentic 80s pop culture references and the well-crafted storyline make it a must-watch. It brilliantly captures the essence of the time, taking us on a suspenseful and heartwarming journey. A nostalgic masterpiece!",Positive
9,Arguably Netflix's greatest original.,Positive

7,"It’s alright. Not the best show I’ve ever seen, not the worst show I’ve ever seen. It’s just alright. I’ve seen scarier things before, but I would say it’s a good watch, but it is not perfection.",Positive
10,"This show has something for everyone- horror, comedy, romance, sci-fi, drama, action, thrills. If you are on the gate about watching this, do yourself a favour and watch it.",Positive
9,I love the characters so much! The storylines and characters are so fleshed out and watching it gets me emotional.,Positive
8,"I love this show and its thorough world building, I felt for every character that made me be on the edge of my seat when a point of tension was in the show. I could not part with any of them, but the most recent season I felt unsatisfied. There can be such a thing as too much character development or focus. The show has been slowly widening the scope, leaving Hawkins and introducing International players. Yet I feel that the show is too scared to depart from our group of kids and venture into the world it has created. The military, governments, nations are involved, its a avengers level threat yet I feel that the world doesn't care. Here we are at the end of the world potentially but everyone is smiling and going about their day. I hope that we get to see a big face off between the government/world against the invading dimension. I hope the scope of the show widens past our small group of kids from Hawkins.",Positive
10,"A detective horror story set in the 80s, full of nostalgic throwbacks and a childish fun sense of humor. 10/10 because stranger things has executed exactly what it set out to do and its done so splendidly!",Positive
10,Very good. Amazing story whith very well written Characters and cool Monsters.,Positive

10,"Great show. I really struggle to commit to an entire series yet this show has totally broke the barrier. I absolutely loved this show due to its plot, sound track, and overall premise. This show has a great uniqueness to it, and has been well loved by teens to adults. This show is so well coordinated together. I watched it in under 2 weeks, and considering the fact I’m never able to commit to a show, like I’ve said, this was completely ironic. If you’re looking for a review to change your opinion on whether you should watch it or not because maybe you feel it’s too overrated, make this review the game changer. Great job, Duffer Brothers!",Positive
10,The BEST series I have see for a long time. I like the atmosphere the cast.,Positive
10,The series which never be unseccesful. And 4th season is the best season so far because we can see hole story clearly. Netflix is earning earning money because of this!,Positive
7,Enjoyable show. Season 1 and 4 are particular strong. 2 and 3 are decent. Great horror and drama elements.,Positive
8,"Season 1 : 8,2 At it's core, Stranger Things is a Redemption Story. It's excels in the term of fleshing out all of their character (even the one we didn't see often). Everyone has its flaws, and everyone trying to be better because of it. And through this ""Stranges"" event",Positive
10,"What makes a tv show interesting is very important for the audience. The audience must stay focused and enjoy the tv show the whole time. Quality, characters, story, and entertainment are the best parts of this tv show, which are very important for the audiences and the fans. To start with, the quality of the tv show is top-rated, which means the scenes, clothes, and location is perfectly designed, and it doesn't change over time. For a Tv show, it is essential to stay committed to the first season, which means if it starts excellent, the audience expects it to keep up the same and not change. Stranger things start with exceptional quality and stay the same over time. Characters are always essential in all movies, TV shows, and stranger things have the best characters you can ever imagine. It takes only one episode to fall in love with these beautiful characters and relate to them until the end. At first, you might see them as ""kids,"" but as soon as you see the first episode, you will know this is not a kid's show and is far more interesting than that. The love these kids give to their characters is far greater than their ""roles,"" and this is something it makes this tv show very unique. From seasons one to four, you will see many changes in the characters and environment, but this change is not bad. The characters develop more and grow up, which is very important for what comes next. The writer will add many new characters to the show, which is always reasonable and necessary for the main characters to develop more and get more power using their team. The storyline is far from unique. It stays interesting every minute and makes you wonder what will happen next. The storyline is about two different worlds and how they met. The characters are doing a great job, and they grow up with the storyline, which makes the tv show and the storyline more believable. The storyline keeps getting stronger and more powerful after each episode, and at some point, you feel like you can't stop watching and Entertainment is one of the most outstanding qualities of this amazing tv show. Once you start watching this tv show, there is no going back, and you will not regret it. The tv show will keep you wondering while answering all of your questions about the environment, characters, and even storyline. Netflix has done a great job creating this unique and memorable tv show. One of the good things about this tv show for me was the 1980s environment and how good and comfortable the cast created every moment with tiny details and love.",Positive

10,"Stranger Things is my personal most favourite show of all time ,I remember starting the show early 2017 and was so invested in the characters and plot that it just made me binge through 2 seasons in a day. Stranger Things is the type of show to just progress and get better each season and now that Stranger Things 4 is out I have no words to describe how i felt about this season,but i can say that it is definitely the best season yet.",Positive
10,"This show is fantastic. The cast is great, the story is well-told, and there are very few things that I would change to make the show better.",Positive
10,Absolute must-see television. The Duffer Brothers knock it out of the park for what I believe is the series' best season so far. There are so many twists and turns and it had me on the edge of my seat the whole time. This is one of the most addicting series that I have ever watched. Season 4 Volume 1 exceeded my wildest expectations and I felt like it was a season that was exceptionally well written.,Positive

8,"Having heard nearly nothing but good, actually great, things about 'Stranger Things', despite it attracting some criticism (like a lot of popular shows do these days, interest was high watching it. Due to being so intrigued by its concept and various ideas and tones. 'Stranger Things' on the most part is deserving of the love it has, for me its lack of originality was not a problem because it executes so much of everything else so wonderfully. It is not perfect and not an even in quality show, but when it was good, as shown in a quite excellent first season, boy was it more than great. Along with 'The Crown' and 'House of Cards' in its prime, 'Stranger Things' is one of the best Netflix has done and in well above their general standard. Do agree absolutely that Season 2 is not near as good as Season 1. There are still a lot of elements present in Season 2 that was especially good about the first season and part of the show's appeal, but somehow the writing didn't always feel as tight, focused or rounded and some of it was a bit forced and obvious. Also felt some of the effects weren't as refined either. While the acting is great from almost all the cast, Winona Ryder's melodramatic over-acting did feel at odds with everything else. Everything else is executed so well. A vast majority of the time, apart from the lack of refinement of some of the effect in the second season, the production values are just great. Very stylish and atmospheric, with some truly beautiful images that one can't believe such high quality comes from a Netflix show. The music is haunting and nostalgic. Writing is thought probing and has a lot of brains and heart, with some nice gentle humour that doesn't overpower, some truly poignant drama and tension. The story is rich in atmosphere and even though the story ideas are not original and have been understandably described as derivative, it's the execution and telling of these ideas that makes one look past that. The suspenseful mystery elements, the inventive and intriguing sci-fi elements and dark and disturbing horror elements are beautifully balanced and handled adeptly on their own. With an emotional core and nostalgic homages added as well. Characters are compelling and it's the chemistry and interaction and how the relationships are written that makes 'Stranger Things' work so well. Excepting Ryder, the acting is terrific. The standouts being Finn Wolfhard and particularly Millie Bobby Brown (such an expressive actress in a beyond-her-years subtle way), if they continue to act this way and be wise with their career choices they are very likely to have big careers. Overall, very good show and at its best excellent. Do wish that Season 2 was as good as the first though. 8/10 Bethany Cox",Positive
10,"Watched over the last few weeks and I can't believe that I slept through it and where does the good children's drama come from all of a sudden? Even something like ES was really good in this respect. Inspiring, grandiose and incredibly exciting from start to finish. Stranger Things as a mix of thriller, mystery and drama delivers on an incredibly good level and has catapulted itself directly to the most popular series with my girlfriend and me. Hopper is the pillar and superbly characterized and acted. Otherwise, the development of all other characters or newly added figures is absolutely coherent and meaningfully woven into the series. Harrington e.g. is going through a really strong development. Likewise, the story, which is often told on different levels, is so well connected that each merging of the individual strands never seems superimposed, but fits completely organically into the narrative and everything follows a common thread. It then jumps again and again between the individual stories, but they are absolutely exciting on their own and then lead to a really satisfying result. We are absolutely thrilled and can't wait for Season 4. I actually never had the feeling that I was watching a bad episode, only one or the other scene was a bit lengthy. By the way, the effects are exceptionally well done and it definitely has its spooky moments. Absolutely recommendable (if someone still lives behind the moon).",Positive
9,"The drama, the story, the narrative and the development of all the characters are an example for several current series of the same genre. The biggest positive point, besides the drama, is that the development of all the characters doesn't take that long and, even so, it delivers a good result.",Positive
10,"One of the best series of all time, the greatest Netflix Production's creation",Positive
9,"I have watched this 3 or 4 times completely. That speaks for itself :D. In my opinion the third season was the best, then the first and the second was the worst.",Positive
10,"Hi, I am from India(Tamilnadu), such a wonderful series. But please let hopper live somewhere and be back at the next episode, please. The only thing that hurt us is that hopper's loss. he is the man of the match.",Positive
10,"Stranger Things as a whole is one of the best shows I have seen so far. All three seasons have been exciting and stunning, from the visuals to the acting and the music. My only wish is that they dont overproduce it in the following seasons 4 (and possibly 5) but give it a good and worthy ending.",Positive
10,"The greatest TV show of all time. Amazing and engaging characters with so much depth, an amazing story that's like a remix of the best parts of the 80s, amazing original 80s synth based music, outstanding visuals, perfect horror atmosphere...everything is just perfect.",Positive
10,"Now that Game of Thrones is over, can we all collectively agree that this is the show that we all watch and discuss with each other?",Positive
10,The BEST Netflix Original Series ever made! I cannot even begin to explain how insanely good this TV Show is...This show has everything...A brilliant story with loveable characters and some fantastic homages and tributes to the old sci fi/horror movies and tv shows of the late 70s and 80s. A full nostalgia trip which makes it feel so fresh and new. If you have a Netflix **** yourself a favor and give yourself some time to watch this from start to finish! Bring on Season 4!,Positive
9,If I am going to be completely honest. This has to be the best Netflix original. Binge-watching every season and knowing each episode is an adventure in itself is amazing,Positive
10,My favrioute netflix seris i would recommened to anyone it is a good show to watch if your bored,Positive

9,Went to this page just to dislike every negative review. The show is good! Whoever made a negative review is a monster.,Positive
10,"Extremely retro style in the 1980s with Stephen King's supernatural terror and detective plot foreshadowing method, the compact plot is like a super long film, the wonderful performances of child stars are especially added, the screen style of neon lights is integrated with the background music of retro pop music, and the carnival of supernatural fans, Cthulhu fans and conspiracy theory guys, this is probably one of the best ways to experience Hollywood in the summer of 1980s.",Positive
10,"Stranger Thing's is one of my favorite shows! It's fun, suspenseful, and the character's are all very interesting. I loved seasons one and three, two was alright, but wasn't as interesting as the others. I can't wait to see what season four will be like.",Positive
9,It is a great and very modern series. Definitely the best series right now (2020). The cast does a real great job (especially Winona Ryder) and it is getting better every season. Season 3 is by far the funniest and best season. This is a must watch!,Positive
9,"A friend recommended this series to me that it is said to be one of the best. Right after a few episodes, I fell in love with this series and it became my favorite. Excellent CGI, great performances by young actors, a wonderful soundtrack and above all the perfect atmosphere of the 80's make Stranger Things what it is. I love it and I can recommend it. Season 1 - 9,5/10 Season 2 - 9/10 Season 3 - 8,5/10 Season 4 - 9,5/10",Positive
9,I love very strange things. I started watching since the release of season 1. And I liked season 3 the most for its atmasphere and scenario.,Positive
8,One of the best shows on **** is incredibly entertaining and the performances are great. Final Grade: A-,Positive
8,Amazing characters and story that captured me from the first episode that made me binge watch the full 3 seasons on Netflix. I love all of the seasons but I kinda felt like season 3 fell short compared to the other two but it still kept me really entertained.,Positive
9,The first and third season of this show are 10/10 but the second season isn't nearly as good. It is my favorite show of all time.,Positive

9,"Great sci-fi adventure. In the first season, I thought that it seemed more like a drama but then you got to the finale and you got prepared for the rest of the show’s action packed episodes. The second season brings back the characters and puts them against a way bigger threat. And the third season... it’s just awesome. I can’t say much about it, because it is so freaking good",Positive

Characters are so well developed, the show just plays with your emotions and the Duffer brothers have created a unique blend of characters that are loved, excellent elements of comedy, friendship, childhood adventure, imagination, and of course mystery & horror.. Cinematography for season 3 was incredible, every episode felt like it was a Spielberg movie.

10,"Review Of Stranger Things S1-S3 Stranger Things S1: Stranger Things S1 is only 3 years old but it already feels like a brilliant classic, the main focus is on the characters which inhabit this twisted yet beautiful fictional town, the show absolutely nails the 80s vibe, classic technology, adverts, architecture and cliches which were prominent at the time. It's got a dark and twisted narrative which manages to hook you after the second episode, a brilliant cast of characters which are all different, well realized and developed and above all a disturbing and somewhat scary antagonist. I wouldn't call Stranger Things (Season One) a horror per se, it's more of a psychological thriller/drama. On top of all this it has an amazing soundtrack, I listen to some of the tunes present in the show on the daily. Overall Stranger Things Season One is near perfect, it manages to nail pretty much everything important but in saying that it does do a few things wrong but overall 8.7/10. Stranger Things S2: The second season is my personal favorite, it once again manages to nail everything the first season did and improve on some things the first season did wrong, character development hits an all time high in this season, relationships that were already established previously are deepened, the performances given by the actors and actresses this time around are a lot more believable as the kids have matured since the previous season. The new additions to the cast are also A+. The stakes are a lot higher in this season although the antagonist isn't as intimidating this time around. I only had one issue with this season, S2 E7 is so out of place and downright boring at times, it completely deviates from the source material and ends up becoming a chore to watch, it feels like a set up for a potential spin off or movie. You could skip E7 and not miss out on any vital information but once this episode is over the brilliance returns. I felt quite satisfied by the time the credits rolled, another solid season. Overall Stranger Things Season Two is an improvement over it's predecessor, 9.5/10. Stranger Things S3: The third season of this brilliant show is once again another solid season but it has some issues. I watched Season 3 twice just to make sure my thoughts and opinions were justified. Season Three doesn't feel like a step forward or back, I say this because it's on par with the previous two seasons but it doesn't improve upon anything. The acting once again was solid and believable, the chemistry between these actors is visible on screen and I feel it adds an extra layer of believability to the show. At this point you care about all of these characters and their relationships, this season explores teen romance and the drama that comes along with it. This is definitely the funniest season of the three, almost all of the jokes land and it feels a lot more lighthearted than the previous two seasons. There are once again new additions to the cast which are once again all brilliant. Now lets get into the negatives, I personally found this season to be a bit of a drag for a while, it has some really bad pacing issues and sub plots that don't lead anywhere. The season starts of pretty strong, we're introduced to the gang again and this makes for some childish fun but as soon as E2 ends, things go South for a bit. It slows down drastically from E3, there are some unnecessary sub plots which don't really make sense and don't lead anywhere, scenes drag on and on because it lacks the same mysterious and disturbing vibe the previous seasons had. The narrative is a mess from E3-E5, things don't make sense, characters are split up into duos and trios and it takes too many liberties, it relies on the fact that you care about these characters rather than telling a cohesive and immersive story. It gets way too unrealistic too, the previous two seasons always felt grounded and believable but this season feels like more of a cartoon than anything else. I didn't feel immersed in the narrative until the final two episodes, there weren't any heart racing moments like the previous two seasons either. It starts picking up the pace after E5 and it makes a huge comeback. Episodes 6,7,8 contain some of the best moments in the entire show, the stakes are raised, the tension builds and you're immersed once again. E7 and E8 are absolutely brilliant, easily the best two episodes in the show. E8 in particular was a masterpiece, everything starts to make sense, the tension goes through the roof and it feels realistic again. I can't express my true views on this episode in writing but I can tell you, it was simply breathtaking. Overall Stranger Things Season Three suffers from slow pacing for a few episodes but as soon as you're ready to find something else to watch it reels you in for an amazing finale. As a result this season's saving grace is it's finale, 10/10 purely because of the brilliant finale. Stranger Things S1, S2 & S3: 9.8/10",Positive
10,This is the best TV show on earth. It builds up slowly but methodically to expand over several seasons. I was amazed with the storytelling. Every piece slowly falls into place to create a grand finale that will be mastered to blow your mind away...,Positive
10,"This serie is so incredible and perfect, when a i see for the first time i stay like ""OH MY GOD""",Positive
10,This is literally the best show ever. Season Three left me in tears of shock thanks to one of the saddest endings of all time (probably in second place after I Am Legend). There is literally no show that I would rather watch than this.,Positive
8,great characters and a welcome throw back to the 80’s pop culture. Season 3 showed signs of fatigue and lack of originality.,Positive
8,"Is great show , every season is better and better i love it so much In season 3. Dustin , steve and robin are the best and maybe Érica too but in a low importante role",Positive
10,"Must watch for sure. If you like Sci-Fi, Old 20th century style or mystery / horror, you’re guaranteed to enjoy these series.",Positive
10,"The magic might be gone but the nostalgia that it has sought to exploit since the first season is still very much present. Objectively, there are better shows out there. However, if you were in love with the first season, Season 3 will feel like a test. For me, it was passed successfully. There is no middle ground here. The relationship I have with the show might be a bit wobblier but that's just the end of the honeymoon phase. The love remains real. A show for the ages, there is no doubt about that.",Positive
10,"Awesome show!!! All the 80s you can handle and monsters, what's not to love! Hopper is a great flawed hero, he takes his lumps and keeps on fighting and Joyce is a headstrong out of the box thinking perfect counterpart to Hop. Everyone brings there own set of skills and flaws which ultimately make everyone very human and understandable/relatable. Great action, great humor, edge of your seat moments and heart tugs is what you get with this one... DON'T MISS IT!!!",Positive
10,After seeing this whole season. I have to say. This was the best Season yet. Glad I saw this one.,Positive
10,"I absolutely hate that Netflix is taking out all the cigarette smoking in the shows. Like what the hell in the 80s everyone used to smoke, it’s what put the show together. It’s relatable to some older people. Yes smoking is bad but honestly so many people are so sensitive now. Grow a pair and if you don’t like it then move tf on",Positive
9,"How a show gets better as it goes on is amazing to me. The season seems to culminate ideas from The Thing, Terminator and even Red Dawn. Overall a must-watch for the summer.",Positive
9,"Alot better than season 2, very nice, very good, very spicy and oh so nicey",Positive
9,"The best season so far, with an amazing attention to detail that is the perfect gestalt of a 80's action movie.",Positive
9,"Season three ratchets up all of the things about the show that we love. I think in furthering the character development, a few of our beloved characters get a little lost in the shuffle. I’m talking about you Jim Hopper! For the most part though, all of our terror and anxiety is amped up through the incredible work done by Dacre Montgomery as Billy. His sings with Millie Bobby Brown as Eleven are especially intense and at times heartfelt. Our supporting cast is there in ways that we haven’t seen before and we get new and interesting groups that are both funny and touching. This season doesn’t disappoint and only makes you want season for all the more.",Positive
8,"Excellent first season, Nice second season, Bad final season. It is an amazing sci-fi story, and you really start to care about the characters, but at the end, it fails to develop some characters and keep using some that aren't even relevant.",Positive
10,[SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.],Positive
8,"+Excellent cast +Great cinematography +Noticably larger production value -Screenplay and characters feel contrived this time around Dont get me wrong, S3 is a very enjoyable and high quality outing but a few **** points stopped it from achieving perfection this time around... EG:-why is Joyce so intensly motivated to solve the disturbances? Why is hopper now a great number of IQ points lower than previous outings?? The motivations of the characters just feel too convenient and inserts for the sake of 'team up 80's style' moments and the various odd almost sketch like setups.. I miss those natural, slower paced moments of S1. Nonetheless STS3 is one heck of a show to watch in 2019.",Positive
10,A classic nostalgic feel and expert character building Stranger Things is a brilliant show. It is amazing!,Positive
10,Amazing! Breathtaking! This may just be the best show on Netflix. Everything about the show is perfect. You must to watch it.,Positive
10,"Breathtaking! This may just be the best show on Netflix. Everything is fantastic. The show is set in the 1980's, and that works well with the plot devices and really makes the show possible. The characters on this show are very well fleshed out, and they all feel like real people, even minor characters that are only present in 1 or 2 scenes. The pacing on the show is also fantastic. The show only tells the viewer little bits of information, enough that they know what is going on, but not too much that it just gives away the answers. This keeps the show interesting. The acting is great too... You have to watch it!",Positive
10,"By far the best season. The characters emotions felt real, it was horrorfying in all the right ways. I came out of watching this season excited for season 4. The actors are phenomanal. Character Arcs from season 1 and 2 end in the best way possible. It felt like an extension of the series making ever so more powerful. I do wish we saw nancy be a bit more useful, otherwise great show, a definite must watch!",Positive
8,"Hawkins, Indiana faces a familiar but more lethal threat this time around as Soviet forces are attempting to bring back the alien life forms to use as weapons. Eleven, Mike, Will and the rest of the gang come together once again to get rid of this threat once and for all. Millie Bobby Brown is a STAR. I have said that before but I really believe it now. She has put a stamp on her future after three strong seasons of this series and I cannot wait to see what she does for the big screen (and hopefully she gets casted in better films than Godzilla: King of the Monsters). I don’t have to mention this but of course Winona Ryder and David Harbour provide great performances per usual but the surprise standout has to be Priah Ferguson who portrays Erica (Lucas’ little sister). She was sampled a little bit in season 2 and I guess the filmmakers answered our requests that she gets a lot more screen time. And I’m glad to say she becomes part of the main cast and she had me laughing after every line of dialogue. We all should come to know that Stranger Things always gives us great, clever writing with a really good suspense/thriller story. This season probably provides my favorite story as we finally move away from Will being the constant host of the “Demagorgons” and the stakes become much higher and grand. And as time in this series progresses, obviously our core cast of teens are aging. They aren’t kids anymore so there are some realistic aspects thrown in on some of them getting into their first relationship and others feeling left out and pushed to the side. Very relatable to us all whether we feel on either spectrum. Our main cast splits into four different story lines and I was invested into all of them for the most part. I will not lie that it took me a couple episodes to really get going into the story line that involves Chief Hopper and Joyce Byers. But as their story progresses, I couldn’t help but to love the outcome. This specific season most likely ends off on the most emotional note compared to the previous two. And that is not possible without the great writing and character development that the Duffer Brothers seem to give the main cast. And I absolutely adored the setting of this series as it takes place around and on July 4th. The set design and cinematography is so colorful and vibrant and the last two seasons do not match up to this third season as far as looks go. I have to sleep on this third season a bit before I say that it is my favorite but just the fact that I am thinking about it... definitely means you all will enjoy this new installment of Stranger Things. Happy binging!!!",Positive
9,"Best show on Netflix. Amazing characters, they are all built with a inusual kind of precision for a TVshow. The Seasons are always better and the story works very well in all the details. Something special with a perfect, young cast. Scare, fun and a little bit of drama make Stranger Things a masterpiece!",Positive

10,"One of the best seasons I have ever seen. its filled with amazing moments,some of the most scariest Scenes I have ever seen and also one of the best villains yet in vecna.",Positive
8,"This is a tough one, now I watched Seasons 1 - 4, I binged the living **** out of it, and I gotta say, I never thought I'd like this. I'm very happy that I caught this series just in time for next year. So this series is an 8/10 because it suffers from some incorrect scientific fiction. The other thing is that the characters in most cases are incredibly stupid, especially in season 4 where it's noticeable. The writers struggled with Seasons 3 - 4 because they forgot certain logic that was explained in S1 - 2. I can only hope they rewatch what they made for S5, because if it continues with the same writing from S4, then oh boy we have a Game of Thrones Situation coming. Anyway, the way this Series is composed with its cinematography characters and Cool and Fun Sci-fi, it's **** far.",Positive
9,[SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.],Positive
10,"I still have no idea how they do it, but somehow they manage to keep the series going and that each time it goes up a level more than the previous one, without a doubt it’s a good series that everyone should watch.",Positive

9,"Is Stranger Things actually worth watching? Stranger things - it’s a science fiction horror drama. Moreover, it involves the topics such as love, friendship, school issues and so on. This TV series is about a group of teenagers who is trying to save their town by fighting horrific monsters. The plot is super unique, the scenes are thrilling and the character development is amazing. The directors, The Duffer Brothers, have come up with a brilliant idea for the series. They have managed to create a TV show for people of all ages. The Stranger things series has four seasons. The fifth one will come out at the end of 2025 year. Each season consists of 8-11 episodes. The actors’ cast has been selected correctly. Every actor suits its character. That helps you to immerse yourself in the theme of the series. The single disadvantage is about the episode release time. Fans always have to wait about 2-3 years to watch a new season. It’s too long, because with the passage of time, you start to forget last episodes, so you have to rewatch the TV show to recall the details in your memory. In general, it’s the best way to spend your free time with pleasure watching something interesting. Try to offer it to your family and friends. They’ll like your idea.",Positive
8,Stranger things is a good show for me and I can't wait for the fifth season,Positive
7,It's very good for the first few seasons after that I kinda feel like it over stays It's welcome,Positive
10,"A series that contains everything to be good, script, soundtrack that fits perfectly at the right moments, charismatic characters, actors who were born to play their roles and a wonderful direction, one of the greatest series ever made in humanity and that marked and will mark many people still.",Positive
10,"""Stranger Things"" is a thrilling nostalgia trip for anyone who grew up in the 80s. The show's homage to classics like A Nightmare on Elm Street and Aliens is a delightful treat for fans of that era. The authentic 80s pop culture references and the well-crafted storyline make it a must-watch. It brilliantly captures the essence of the time, taking us on a suspenseful and heartwarming journey. A nostalgic masterpiece!",Positive

7,"It’s alright. Not the best show I’ve ever seen, not the worst show I’ve ever seen. It’s just alright. I’ve seen scarier things before, but I would say it’s a good watch, but it is not perfection.",Positive

9,I love the characters so much! The storylines and characters are so fleshed out and watching it gets me emotional.,Positive
8,"I love this show and its thorough world building, I felt for every character that made me be on the edge of my seat when a point of tension was in the show. I could not part with any of them, but the most recent season I felt unsatisfied. There can be such a thing as too much character development or focus. The show has been slowly widening the scope, leaving Hawkins and introducing International players. Yet I feel that the show is too scared to depart from our group of kids and venture into the world it has created. The military, governments, nations are involved, its a avengers level threat yet I feel that the world doesn't care. Here we are at the end of the world potentially but everyone is smiling and going about their day. I hope that we get to see a big face off between the government/world against the invading dimension. I hope the scope of the show widens past our small group of kids from Hawkins.",Positive
10,"A detective horror story set in the 80s, full of nostalgic throwbacks and a childish fun sense of humor. 10/10 because stranger things has executed exactly what it set out to do and its done so splendidly!",Positive
10,Very good. Amazing story whith very well written Characters and cool Monsters.,Positive
10,[SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.],Positive
10,"Great show. I really struggle to commit to an entire series yet this show has totally broke the barrier. I absolutely loved this show due to its plot, sound track, and overall premise. This show has a great uniqueness to it, and has been well loved by teens to adults. This show is so well coordinated together. I watched it in under 2 weeks, and considering the fact I’m never able to commit to a show, like I’ve said, this was completely ironic. If you’re looking for a review to change your opinion on whether you should watch it or not because maybe you feel it’s too overrated, make this review the game changer. Great job, Duffer Brothers!",Positive
10,The BEST series I have see for a long time. I like the atmosphere the cast.,Positive
10,The series which never be unseccesful. And 4th season is the best season so far because we can see hole story clearly. Netflix is earning earning money because of this!,Positive
7,Enjoyable show. Season 1 and 4 are particular strong. 2 and 3 are decent. Great horror and drama elements.,Positive
8,"Season 1 : 8,2 At it's core, Stranger Things is a Redemption Story. It's excels in the term of fleshing out all of their character (even the one we didn't see often). Everyone has its flaws, and everyone trying to be better because of it. And through this ""Stranges"" event",Positive
10,"What makes a tv show interesting is very important for the audience. The audience must stay focused and enjoy the tv show the whole time. Quality, characters, story, and entertainment are the best parts of this tv show, which are very important for the audiences and the fans. To start with, the quality of the tv show is top-rated, which means the scenes, clothes, and location is perfectly designed, and it doesn't change over time. For a Tv show, it is essential to stay committed to the first season, which means if it starts excellent, the audience expects it to keep up the same and not change. Stranger things start with exceptional quality and stay the same over time. Characters are always essential in all movies, TV shows, and stranger things have the best characters you can ever imagine. It takes only one episode to fall in love with these beautiful characters and relate to them until the end. At first, you might see them as ""kids,"" but as soon as you see the first episode, you will know this is not a kid's show and is far more interesting than that. The love these kids give to their characters is far greater than their ""roles,"" and this is something it makes this tv show very unique. From seasons one to four, you will see many changes in the characters and environment, but this change is not bad. The characters develop more and grow up, which is very important for what comes next. The writer will add many new characters to the show, which is always reasonable and necessary for the main characters to develop more and get more power using their team. The storyline is far from unique. It stays interesting every minute and makes you wonder what will happen next. The storyline is about two different worlds and how they met. The characters are doing a great job, and they grow up with the storyline, which makes the tv show and the storyline more believable. The storyline keeps getting stronger and more powerful after each episode, and at some point, you feel like you can't stop watching and Entertainment is one of the most outstanding qualities of this amazing tv show. Once you start watching this tv show, there is no going back, and you will not regret it. The tv show will keep you wondering while answering all of your questions about the environment, characters, and even storyline. Netflix has done a great job creating this unique and memorable tv show. One of the good things about this tv show for me was the 1980s environment and how good and comfortable the cast created every moment with tiny details and love.",Positive

10,wow this was amazing ... thank you sooo much for such an epic season... best one so far,Positive
10,"Stranger Things is my personal most favourite show of all time ,I remember starting the show early 2017 and was so invested in the characters and plot that it just made me binge through 2 seasons in a day. Stranger Things is the type of show to just progress and get better each season and now that Stranger Things 4 is out I have no words to describe how i felt about this season,but i can say that it is definitely the best season yet.",Positive
10,"This show is fantastic. The cast is great, the story is well-told, and there are very few things that I would change to make the show better.",Positive
10,Absolute must-see television. The Duffer Brothers knock it out of the park for what I believe is the series' best season so far. There are so many twists and turns and it had me on the edge of my seat the whole time. This is one of the most addicting series that I have ever watched. Season 4 Volume 1 exceeded my wildest expectations and I felt like it was a season that was exceptionally well written.,Positive

8,"Having heard nearly nothing but good, actually great, things about 'Stranger Things', despite it attracting some criticism (like a lot of popular shows do these days, interest was high watching it. Due to being so intrigued by its concept and various ideas and tones. 'Stranger Things' on the most part is deserving of the love it has, for me its lack of originality was not a problem because it executes so much of everything else so wonderfully. It is not perfect and not an even in quality show, but when it was good, as shown in a quite excellent first season, boy was it more than great. Along with 'The Crown' and 'House of Cards' in its prime, 'Stranger Things' is one of the best Netflix has done and in well above their general standard. Do agree absolutely that Season 2 is not near as good as Season 1. There are still a lot of elements present in Season 2 that was especially good about the first season and part of the show's appeal, but somehow the writing didn't always feel as tight, focused or rounded and some of it was a bit forced and obvious. Also felt some of the effects weren't as refined either. While the acting is great from almost all the cast, Winona Ryder's melodramatic over-acting did feel at odds with everything else. Everything else is executed so well. A vast majority of the time, apart from the lack of refinement of some of the effect in the second season, the production values are just great. Very stylish and atmospheric, with some truly beautiful images that one can't believe such high quality comes from a Netflix show. The music is haunting and nostalgic. Writing is thought probing and has a lot of brains and heart, with some nice gentle humour that doesn't overpower, some truly poignant drama and tension. The story is rich in atmosphere and even though the story ideas are not original and have been understandably described as derivative, it's the execution and telling of these ideas that makes one look past that. The suspenseful mystery elements, the inventive and intriguing sci-fi elements and dark and disturbing horror elements are beautifully balanced and handled adeptly on their own. With an emotional core and nostalgic homages added as well. Characters are compelling and it's the chemistry and interaction and how the relationships are written that makes 'Stranger Things' work so well. Excepting Ryder, the acting is terrific. The standouts being Finn Wolfhard and particularly Millie Bobby Brown (such an expressive actress in a beyond-her-years subtle way), if they continue to act this way and be wise with their career choices they are very likely to have big careers. Overall, very good show and at its best excellent. Do wish that Season 2 was as good as the first though. 8/10 Bethany Cox",Positive
10,"Watched over the last few weeks and I can't believe that I slept through it and where does the good children's drama come from all of a sudden? Even something like ES was really good in this respect. Inspiring, grandiose and incredibly exciting from start to finish. Stranger Things as a mix of thriller, mystery and drama delivers on an incredibly good level and has catapulted itself directly to the most popular series with my girlfriend and me. Hopper is the pillar and superbly characterized and acted. Otherwise, the development of all other characters or newly added figures is absolutely coherent and meaningfully woven into the series. Harrington e.g. is going through a really strong development. Likewise, the story, which is often told on different levels, is so well connected that each merging of the individual strands never seems superimposed, but fits completely organically into the narrative and everything follows a common thread. It then jumps again and again between the individual stories, but they are absolutely exciting on their own and then lead to a really satisfying result. We are absolutely thrilled and can't wait for Season 4. I actually never had the feeling that I was watching a bad episode, only one or the other scene was a bit lengthy. By the way, the effects are exceptionally well done and it definitely has its spooky moments. Absolutely recommendable (if someone still lives behind the moon).",Positive
9,"The drama, the story, the narrative and the development of all the characters are an example for several current series of the same genre. The biggest positive point, besides the drama, is that the development of all the characters doesn't take that long and, even so, it delivers a good result.",Positive
10,"One of the best series of all time, the greatest Netflix Production's creation",Positive
9,"I have watched this 3 or 4 times completely. That speaks for itself :D. In my opinion the third season was the best, then the first and the second was the worst.",Positive
10,"Hi, I am from India(Tamilnadu), such a wonderful series. But please let hopper live somewhere and be back at the next episode, please. The only thing that hurt us is that hopper's loss. he is the man of the match.",Positive
10,"Stranger Things as a whole is one of the best shows I have seen so far. All three seasons have been exciting and stunning, from the visuals to the acting and the music. My only wish is that they dont overproduce it in the following seasons 4 (and possibly 5) but give it a good and worthy ending.",Positive
10,"The greatest TV show of all time. Amazing and engaging characters with so much depth, an amazing story that's like a remix of the best parts of the 80s, amazing original 80s synth based music, outstanding visuals, perfect horror atmosphere...everything is just perfect.",Positive
10,"Now that Game of Thrones is over, can we all collectively agree that this is the show that we all watch and discuss with each other?",Positive
10,The BEST Netflix Original Series ever made! I cannot even begin to explain how insanely good this TV Show is...This show has everything...A brilliant story with loveable characters and some fantastic homages and tributes to the old sci fi/horror movies and tv shows of the late 70s and 80s. A full nostalgia trip which makes it feel so fresh and new. If you have a Netflix **** yourself a favor and give yourself some time to watch this from start to finish! Bring on Season 4!,Positive

10,"Extremely retro style in the 1980s with Stephen King's supernatural terror and detective plot foreshadowing method, the compact plot is like a super long film, the wonderful performances of child stars are especially added, the screen style of neon lights is integrated with the background music of retro pop music, and the carnival of supernatural fans, Cthulhu fans and conspiracy theory guys, this is probably one of the best ways to experience Hollywood in the summer of 1980s.",Positive
10,"Stranger Thing's is one of my favorite shows! It's fun, suspenseful, and the character's are all very interesting. I loved seasons one and three, two was alright, but wasn't as interesting as the others. I can't wait to see what season four will be like.",Positive

10,"Review Of Stranger Things S1-S3 Stranger Things S1: Stranger Things S1 is only 3 years old but it already feels like a brilliant classic, the main focus is on the characters which inhabit this twisted yet beautiful fictional town, the show absolutely nails the 80s vibe, classic technology, adverts, architecture and cliches which were prominent at the time. It's got a dark and twisted narrative which manages to hook you after the second episode, a brilliant cast of characters which are all different, well realized and developed and above all a disturbing and somewhat scary antagonist. I wouldn't call Stranger Things (Season One) a horror per se, it's more of a psychological thriller/drama. On top of all this it has an amazing soundtrack, I listen to some of the tunes present in the show on the daily. Overall Stranger Things Season One is near perfect, it manages to nail pretty much everything important but in saying that it does do a few things wrong but overall 8.7/10. Stranger Things S2: The second season is my personal favorite, it once again manages to nail everything the first season did and improve on some things the first season did wrong, character development hits an all time high in this season, relationships that were already established previously are deepened, the performances given by the actors and actresses this time around are a lot more believable as the kids have matured since the previous season. The new additions to the cast are also A+. The stakes are a lot higher in this season although the antagonist isn't as intimidating this time around. I only had one issue with this season, S2 E7 is so out of place and downright boring at times, it completely deviates from the source material and ends up becoming a chore to watch, it feels like a set up for a potential spin off or movie. You could skip E7 and not miss out on any vital information but once this episode is over the brilliance returns. I felt quite satisfied by the time the credits rolled, another solid season. Overall Stranger Things Season Two is an improvement over it's predecessor, 9.5/10. Stranger Things S3: The third season of this brilliant show is once again another solid season but it has some issues. I watched Season 3 twice just to make sure my thoughts and opinions were justified. Season Three doesn't feel like a step forward or back, I say this because it's on par with the previous two seasons but it doesn't improve upon anything. The acting once again was solid and believable, the chemistry between these actors is visible on screen and I feel it adds an extra layer of believability to the show. At this point you care about all of these characters and their relationships, this season explores teen romance and the drama that comes along with it. This is definitely the funniest season of the three, almost all of the jokes land and it feels a lot more lighthearted than the previous two seasons. There are once again new additions to the cast which are once again all brilliant. Now lets get into the negatives, I personally found this season to be a bit of a drag for a while, it has some really bad pacing issues and sub plots that don't lead anywhere. The season starts of pretty strong, we're introduced to the gang again and this makes for some childish fun but as soon as E2 ends, things go South for a bit. It slows down drastically from E3, there are some unnecessary sub plots which don't really make sense and don't lead anywhere, scenes drag on and on because it lacks the same mysterious and disturbing vibe the previous seasons had. The narrative is a mess from E3-E5, things don't make sense, characters are split up into duos and trios and it takes too many liberties, it relies on the fact that you care about these characters rather than telling a cohesive and immersive story. It gets way too unrealistic too, the previous two seasons always felt grounded and believable but this season feels like more of a cartoon than anything else. I didn't feel immersed in the narrative until the final two episodes, there weren't any heart racing moments like the previous two seasons either. It starts picking up the pace after E5 and it makes a huge comeback. Episodes 6,7,8 contain some of the best moments in the entire show, the stakes are raised, the tension builds and you're immersed once again. E7 and E8 are absolutely brilliant, easily the best two episodes in the show. E8 in particular was a masterpiece, everything starts to make sense, the tension goes through the roof and it feels realistic again. I can't express my true views on this episode in writing but I can tell you, it was simply breathtaking. Overall Stranger Things Season Three suffers from slow pacing for a few episodes but as soon as you're ready to find something else to watch it reels you in for an amazing finale. As a result this season's saving grace is it's finale, 10/10 purely because of the brilliant finale. Stranger Things S1, S2 & S3: 9.8/10",Positive
10,This is the best TV show on earth. It builds up slowly but methodically to expand over several seasons. I was amazed with the storytelling. Every piece slowly falls into place to create a grand finale that will be mastered to blow your mind away...,Positive
10,"This serie is so incredible and perfect, when a i see for the first time i stay like ""OH MY GOD""",Positive
10,This is literally the best show ever. Season Three left me in tears of shock thanks to one of the saddest endings of all time (probably in second place after I Am Legend). There is literally no show that I would rather watch than this.,Positive
8,great characters and a welcome throw back to the 80’s pop culture. Season 3 showed signs of fatigue and lack of originality.,Positive
8,"Is great show , every season is better and better i love it so much In season 3. Dustin , steve and robin are the best and maybe Érica too but in a low importante role",Positive
10,"Must watch for sure. If you like Sci-Fi, Old 20th century style or mystery / horror, you’re guaranteed to enjoy these series.",Positive
10,"The magic might be gone but the nostalgia that it has sought to exploit since the first season is still very much present. Objectively, there are better shows out there. However, if you were in love with the first season, Season 3 will feel like a test. For me, it was passed successfully. There is no middle ground here. The relationship I have with the show might be a bit wobblier but that's just the end of the honeymoon phase. The love remains real. A show for the ages, there is no doubt about that.",Positive
10,"Awesome show!!! All the 80s you can handle and monsters, what's not to love! Hopper is a great flawed hero, he takes his lumps and keeps on fighting and Joyce is a headstrong out of the box thinking perfect counterpart to Hop. Everyone brings there own set of skills and flaws which ultimately make everyone very human and understandable/relatable. Great action, great humor, edge of your seat moments and heart tugs is what you get with this one... DON'T MISS IT!!!",Positive
10,After seeing this whole season. I have to say. This was the best Season yet. Glad I saw this one.,Positive
10,"I absolutely hate that Netflix is taking out all the cigarette smoking in the shows. Like what the hell in the 80s everyone used to smoke, it’s what put the show together. It’s relatable to some older people. Yes smoking is bad but honestly so many people are so sensitive now. Grow a pair and if you don’t like it then move tf on",Positive
9,"How a show gets better as it goes on is amazing to me. The season seems to culminate ideas from The Thing, Terminator and even Red Dawn. Overall a must-watch for the summer.",Positive
9,"Alot better than season 2, very nice, very good, very spicy and oh so nicey",Positive
9,"The best season so far, with an amazing attention to detail that is the perfect gestalt of a 80's action movie.",Positive
9,"Season three ratchets up all of the things about the show that we love. I think in furthering the character development, a few of our beloved characters get a little lost in the shuffle. I’m talking about you Jim Hopper! For the most part though, all of our terror and anxiety is amped up through the incredible work done by Dacre Montgomery as Billy. His sings with Millie Bobby Brown as Eleven are especially intense and at times heartfelt. Our supporting cast is there in ways that we haven’t seen before and we get new and interesting groups that are both funny and touching. This season doesn’t disappoint and only makes you want season for all the more.",Positive
8,"Excellent first season, Nice second season, Bad final season. It is an amazing sci-fi story, and you really start to care about the characters, but at the end, it fails to develop some characters and keep using some that aren't even relevant.",Positive
10,[SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.],Positive
8,"+Excellent cast +Great cinematography +Noticably larger production value -Screenplay and characters feel contrived this time around Dont get me wrong, S3 is a very enjoyable and high quality outing but a few **** points stopped it from achieving perfection this time around... EG:-why is Joyce so intensly motivated to solve the disturbances? Why is hopper now a great number of IQ points lower than previous outings?? The motivations of the characters just feel too convenient and inserts for the sake of 'team up 80's style' moments and the various odd almost sketch like setups.. I miss those natural, slower paced moments of S1. Nonetheless STS3 is one heck of a show to watch in 2019.",Positive
10,A classic nostalgic feel and expert character building Stranger Things is a brilliant show. It is amazing!,Positive
10,Amazing! Breathtaking! This may just be the best show on Netflix. Everything about the show is perfect. You must to watch it.,Positive
10,"Breathtaking! This may just be the best show on Netflix. Everything is fantastic. The show is set in the 1980's, and that works well with the plot devices and really makes the show possible. The characters on this show are very well fleshed out, and they all feel like real people, even minor characters that are only present in 1 or 2 scenes. The pacing on the show is also fantastic. The show only tells the viewer little bits of information, enough that they know what is going on, but not too much that it just gives away the answers. This keeps the show interesting. The acting is great too... You have to watch it!",Positive
10,"By far the best season. The characters emotions felt real, it was horrorfying in all the right ways. I came out of watching this season excited for season 4. The actors are phenomanal. Character Arcs from season 1 and 2 end in the best way possible. It felt like an extension of the series making ever so more powerful. I do wish we saw nancy be a bit more useful, otherwise great show, a definite must watch!",Positive
8,"Hawkins, Indiana faces a familiar but more lethal threat this time around as Soviet forces are attempting to bring back the alien life forms to use as weapons. Eleven, Mike, Will and the rest of the gang come together once again to get rid of this threat once and for all. Millie Bobby Brown is a STAR. I have said that before but I really believe it now. She has put a stamp on her future after three strong seasons of this series and I cannot wait to see what she does for the big screen (and hopefully she gets casted in better films than Godzilla: King of the Monsters). I don’t have to mention this but of course Winona Ryder and David Harbour provide great performances per usual but the surprise standout has to be Priah Ferguson who portrays Erica (Lucas’ little sister). She was sampled a little bit in season 2 and I guess the filmmakers answered our requests that she gets a lot more screen time. And I’m glad to say she becomes part of the main cast and she had me laughing after every line of dialogue. We all should come to know that Stranger Things always gives us great, clever writing with a really good suspense/thriller story. This season probably provides my favorite story as we finally move away from Will being the constant host of the “Demagorgons” and the stakes become much higher and grand. And as time in this series progresses, obviously our core cast of teens are aging. They aren’t kids anymore so there are some realistic aspects thrown in on some of them getting into their first relationship and others feeling left out and pushed to the side. Very relatable to us all whether we feel on either spectrum. Our main cast splits into four different story lines and I was invested into all of them for the most part. I will not lie that it took me a couple episodes to really get going into the story line that involves Chief Hopper and Joyce Byers. But as their story progresses, I couldn’t help but to love the outcome. This specific season most likely ends off on the most emotional note compared to the previous two. And that is not possible without the great writing and character development that the Duffer Brothers seem to give the main cast. And I absolutely adored the setting of this series as it takes place around and on July 4th. The set design and cinematography is so colorful and vibrant and the last two seasons do not match up to this third season as far as looks go. I have to sleep on this third season a bit before I say that it is my favorite but just the fact that I am thinking about it... definitely means you all will enjoy this new installment of Stranger Things. Happy binging!!!",Positive
9,"Best show on Netflix. Amazing characters, they are all built with a inusual kind of precision for a TVshow. The Seasons are always better and the story works very well in all the details. Something special with a perfect, young cast. Scare, fun and a little bit of drama make Stranger Things a masterpiece!",Positive
10,"Quite simply the greatest show of all time. Visuals are dazzling, characters are full, story is amazing, and it’s addictive AF.",Positive
10,"This might just be the best show on Netflix. Everything about the show is fantastic. The show is set in the 1980's, and that works well with the plot devices and really makes the show possible.

The acting is great too. Every actor or actress is putting in a lot of effort, and that goes for both children and adults. If you are reading this review and have not yet checked out Stranger Things, you must.",Positive
10,"One of the best seasons I have ever seen. its filled with amazing moments,some of the most scariest Scenes I have ever seen and also one of the best villains yet in vecna.",Positive
8,"This is a tough one, now I watched Seasons 1 - 4, I binged the living **** out of it, and I gotta say, I never thought I'd like this. I'm very happy that I caught this series just in time for next year. So this series is an 8/10 because it suffers from some incorrect scientific fiction. The other thing is that the characters in most cases are incredibly stupid, especially in season 4 where it's noticeable. The writers struggled with Seasons 3 - 4 because they forgot certain logic that was explained in S1 - 2. I can only hope they rewatch what they made for S5, because if it continues with the same writing from S4, then oh boy we have a Game of Thrones Situation coming. Anyway, the way this Series is composed with its cinematography characters and Cool and Fun Sci-fi, it's **** far.",Positive
9,[SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.],Positive
10,"I still have no idea how they do it, but somehow they manage to keep the series going and that each time it goes up a level more than the previous one, without a doubt it’s a good series that everyone should watch.",Positive
8,"Very good throughout, despite there being a few time where the plot falls flat or the scenes feel too long. Apart from that there are very likable characters and role models and great storytelling.",Positive
8,"Very nice tv show , so excited of 5 season, can't wait, actually one of my favorite tv show ever. 8,5/10 solid",Positive
9,"Is Stranger Things actually worth watching? Stranger things - it’s a science fiction horror drama. Moreover, it involves the topics such as love, friendship, school issues and so on. This TV series is about a group of teenagers who is trying to save their town by fighting horrific monsters. The plot is super unique, the scenes are thrilling and the character development is amazing. The directors, The Duffer Brothers, have come up with a brilliant idea for the series. They have managed to create a TV show for people of all ages. The Stranger things series has four seasons. The fifth one will come out at the end of 2025 year. Each season consists of 8-11 episodes. The actors’ cast has been selected correctly. Every actor suits its character. That helps you to immerse yourself in the theme of the series. The single disadvantage is about the episode release time. Fans always have to wait about 2-3 years to watch a new season. It’s too long, because with the passage of time, you start to forget last episodes, so you have to rewatch the TV show to recall the details in your memory. In general, it’s the best way to spend your free time with pleasure watching something interesting. Try to offer it to your family and friends. They’ll like your idea.",Positive
8,Stranger things is a good show for me and I can't wait for the fifth season,Positive
7,It's very good for the first few seasons after that I kinda feel like it over stays It's welcome,Positive
10,"A series that contains everything to be good, script, soundtrack that fits perfectly at the right moments, charismatic characters, actors who were born to play their roles and a wonderful direction, one of the greatest series ever made in humanity and that marked and will mark many people still.",Positive
10,"""Stranger Things"" is a thrilling nostalgia trip for anyone who grew up in the 80s. The show's homage to classics like A Nightmare on Elm Street and Aliens is a delightful treat for fans of that era. The authentic 80s pop culture references and the well-crafted storyline make it a must-watch. It brilliantly captures the essence of the time, taking us on a suspenseful and heartwarming journey. A nostalgic masterpiece!",Positive
9,Arguably Netflix's greatest original.,Positive
10,Rating: 97 AMAZING Season Ranked: 1. Season 3 Rating: 100 (Masterpiece) 2. Season 4 Rating: 100 (Masterpiece) 3. Season 1 Rating: 100 (Masterpiece) 4. Season 2: Rating: 77 (Good) Full Series Review: Stranger Things is well crafted television show with amazing storytelling and direction from the Duffer Brothers. It also has a incredible cast ensemble especially Millie Bobby Brown and David Harbour who gives phenomenal performances. Overall Stranger Things is a spectacular show and definitely one of the best Netflix Original Show.,Positive
7,"It’s alright. Not the best show I’ve ever seen, not the worst show I’ve ever seen. It’s just alright. I’ve seen scarier things before, but I would say it’s a good watch, but it is not perfection.",Positive
10,"This show has something for everyone- horror, comedy, romance, sci-fi, drama, action, thrills. If you are on the gate about watching this, do yourself a favour and watch it.",Positive
9,I love the characters so much! The storylines and characters are so fleshed out and watching it gets me emotional.,Positive
8,"I love this show and its thorough world building, I felt for every character that made me be on the edge of my seat when a point of tension was in the show. I could not part with any of them, but the most recent season I felt unsatisfied. There can be such a thing as too much character development or focus. The show has been slowly widening the scope, leaving Hawkins and introducing International players. Yet I feel that the show is too scared to depart from our group of kids and venture into the world it has created. The military, governments, nations are involved, its a avengers level threat yet I feel that the world doesn't care. Here we are at the end of the world potentially but everyone is smiling and going about their day. I hope that we get to see a big face off between the government/world against the invading dimension. I hope the scope of the show widens past our small group of kids from Hawkins.",Positive
10,"A detective horror story set in the 80s, full of nostalgic throwbacks and a childish fun sense of humor. 10/10 because stranger things has executed exactly what it set out to do and its done so splendidly!",Positive
10,Very good. Amazing story whith very well written Characters and cool Monsters.,Positive
10,[SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.],Positive
10,"Great show. I really struggle to commit to an entire series yet this show has totally broke the barrier. I absolutely loved this show due to its plot, sound track, and overall premise. This show has a great uniqueness to it, and has been well loved by teens to adults. This show is so well coordinated together. I watched it in under 2 weeks, and considering the fact I’m never able to commit to a show, like I’ve said, this was completely ironic. If you’re looking for a review to change your opinion on whether you should watch it or not because maybe you feel it’s too overrated, make this review the game changer. Great job, Duffer Brothers!",Positive
10,The BEST series I have see for a long time. I like the atmosphere the cast.,Positive
10,The series which never be unseccesful. And 4th season is the best season so far because we can see hole story clearly. Netflix is earning earning money because of this!,Positive
7,Enjoyable show. Season 1 and 4 are particular strong. 2 and 3 are decent. Great horror and drama elements.,Positive
8,"Season 1 : 8,2 At it's core, Stranger Things is a Redemption Story. It's excels in the term of fleshing out all of their character (even the one we didn't see often). Everyone has its flaws, and everyone trying to be better because of it. And through this ""Stranges"" event",Positive
10,"What makes a tv show interesting is very important for the audience. The audience must stay focused and enjoy the tv show the whole time. Quality, characters, story, and entertainment are the best parts of this tv show, which are very important for the audiences and the fans. To start with, the quality of the tv show is top-rated, which means the scenes, clothes, and location is perfectly designed, and it doesn't change over time. For a Tv show, it is essential to stay committed to the first season, which means if it starts excellent, the audience expects it to keep up the same and not change. Stranger things start with exceptional quality and stay the same over time. Characters are always essential in all movies, TV shows, and stranger things have the best characters you can ever imagine. It takes only one episode to fall in love with these beautiful characters and relate to them until the end. At first, you might see them as ""kids,"" but as soon as you see the first episode, you will know this is not a kid's show and is far more interesting than that. The love these kids give to their characters is far greater than their ""roles,"" and this is something it makes this tv show very unique. From seasons one to four, you will see many changes in the characters and environment, but this change is not bad. The characters develop more and grow up, which is very important for what comes next. The writer will add many new characters to the show, which is always reasonable and necessary for the main characters to develop more and get more power using their team. The storyline is far from unique. It stays interesting every minute and makes you wonder what will happen next. The storyline is about two different worlds and how they met. The characters are doing a great job, and they grow up with the storyline, which makes the tv show and the storyline more believable. The storyline keeps getting stronger and more powerful after each episode, and at some point, you feel like you can't stop watching and Entertainment is one of the most outstanding qualities of this amazing tv show. Once you start watching this tv show, there is no going back, and you will not regret it. The tv show will keep you wondering while answering all of your questions about the environment, characters, and even storyline. Netflix has done a great job creating this unique and memorable tv show. One of the good things about this tv show for me was the 1980s environment and how good and comfortable the cast created every moment with tiny details and love.",Positive

10,wow this was amazing ... thank you sooo much for such an epic season... best one so far,Positive
10,"Stranger Things is my personal most favourite show of all time ,I remember starting the show early 2017 and was so invested in the characters and plot that it just made me binge through 2 seasons in a day. Stranger Things is the type of show to just progress and get better each season and now that Stranger Things 4 is out I have no words to describe how i felt about this season,but i can say that it is definitely the best season yet.",Positive
10,"This show is fantastic. The cast is great, the story is well-told, and there are very few things that I would change to make the show better.",Positive
10,Absolute must-see television. The Duffer Brothers knock it out of the park for what I believe is the series' best season so far. There are so many twists and turns and it had me on the edge of my seat the whole time. This is one of the most addicting series that I have ever watched. Season 4 Volume 1 exceeded my wildest expectations and I felt like it was a season that was exceptionally well written.,Positive

8,"Having heard nearly nothing but good, actually great, things about 'Stranger Things', despite it attracting some criticism (like a lot of popular shows do these days, interest was high watching it. Due to being so intrigued by its concept and various ideas and tones. 'Stranger Things' on the most part is deserving of the love it has, for me its lack of originality was not a problem because it executes so much of everything else so wonderfully. It is not perfect and not an even in quality show, but when it was good, as shown in a quite excellent first season, boy was it more than great. Along with 'The Crown' and 'House of Cards' in its prime, 'Stranger Things' is one of the best Netflix has done and in well above their general standard. Do agree absolutely that Season 2 is not near as good as Season 1. There are still a lot of elements present in Season 2 that was especially good about the first season and part of the show's appeal, but somehow the writing didn't always feel as tight, focused or rounded and some of it was a bit forced and obvious. Also felt some of the effects weren't as refined either. While the acting is great from almost all the cast, Winona Ryder's melodramatic over-acting did feel at odds with everything else. Everything else is executed so well. A vast majority of the time, apart from the lack of refinement of some of the effect in the second season, the production values are just great. Very stylish and atmospheric, with some truly beautiful images that one can't believe such high quality comes from a Netflix show. The music is haunting and nostalgic. Writing is thought probing and has a lot of brains and heart, with some nice gentle humour that doesn't overpower, some truly poignant drama and tension. The story is rich in atmosphere and even though the story ideas are not original and have been understandably described as derivative, it's the execution and telling of these ideas that makes one look past that. The suspenseful mystery elements, the inventive and intriguing sci-fi elements and dark and disturbing horror elements are beautifully balanced and handled adeptly on their own. With an emotional core and nostalgic homages added as well. Characters are compelling and it's the chemistry and interaction and how the relationships are written that makes 'Stranger Things' work so well. Excepting Ryder, the acting is terrific. The standouts being Finn Wolfhard and particularly Millie Bobby Brown (such an expressive actress in a beyond-her-years subtle way), if they continue to act this way and be wise with their career choices they are very likely to have big careers. Overall, very good show and at its best excellent. Do wish that Season 2 was as good as the first though. 8/10 Bethany Cox",Positive
10,"Watched over the last few weeks and I can't believe that I slept through it and where does the good children's drama come from all of a sudden? Even something like ES was really good in this respect. Inspiring, grandiose and incredibly exciting from start to finish. Stranger Things as a mix of thriller, mystery and drama delivers on an incredibly good level and has catapulted itself directly to the most popular series with my girlfriend and me. Hopper is the pillar and superbly characterized and acted. Otherwise, the development of all other characters or newly added figures is absolutely coherent and meaningfully woven into the series. Harrington e.g. is going through a really strong development. Likewise, the story, which is often told on different levels, is so well connected that each merging of the individual strands never seems superimposed, but fits completely organically into the narrative and everything follows a common thread. It then jumps again and again between the individual stories, but they are absolutely exciting on their own and then lead to a really satisfying result. We are absolutely thrilled and can't wait for Season 4. I actually never had the feeling that I was watching a bad episode, only one or the other scene was a bit lengthy. By the way, the effects are exceptionally well done and it definitely has its spooky moments. Absolutely recommendable (if someone still lives behind the moon).",Positive
9,"The drama, the story, the narrative and the development of all the characters are an example for several current series of the same genre. The biggest positive point, besides the drama, is that the development of all the characters doesn't take that long and, even so, it delivers a good result.",Positive
10,"One of the best series of all time, the greatest Netflix Production's creation",Positive
9,"I have watched this 3 or 4 times completely. That speaks for itself :D. In my opinion the third season was the best, then the first and the second was the worst.",Positive
10,"Hi, I am from India(Tamilnadu), such a wonderful series. But please let hopper live somewhere and be back at the next episode, please. The only thing that hurt us is that hopper's loss. he is the man of the match.",Positive
10,"Stranger Things as a whole is one of the best shows I have seen so far. All three seasons have been exciting and stunning, from the visuals to the acting and the music. My only wish is that they dont overproduce it in the following seasons 4 (and possibly 5) but give it a good and worthy ending.",Positive
10,"The greatest TV show of all time. Amazing and engaging characters with so much depth, an amazing story that's like a remix of the best parts of the 80s, amazing original 80s synth based music, outstanding visuals, perfect horror atmosphere...everything is just perfect.",Positive
10,"Now that Game of Thrones is over, can we all collectively agree that this is the show that we all watch and discuss with each other?",Positive
10,The BEST Netflix Original Series ever made! I cannot even begin to explain how insanely good this TV Show is...This show has everything...A brilliant story with loveable characters and some fantastic homages and tributes to the old sci fi/horror movies and tv shows of the late 70s and 80s. A full nostalgia trip which makes it feel so fresh and new. If you have a Netflix **** yourself a favor and give yourself some time to watch this from start to finish! Bring on Season 4!,Positive
9,If I am going to be completely honest. This has to be the best Netflix original. Binge-watching every season and knowing each episode is an adventure in itself is amazing,Positive

9,Went to this page just to dislike every negative review. The show is good! Whoever made a negative review is a monster.,Positive
10,"Extremely retro style in the 1980s with Stephen King's supernatural terror and detective plot foreshadowing method, the compact plot is like a super long film, the wonderful performances of child stars are especially added, the screen style of neon lights is integrated with the background music of retro pop music, and the carnival of supernatural fans, Cthulhu fans and conspiracy theory guys, this is probably one of the best ways to experience Hollywood in the summer of 1980s.",Positive
10,"Stranger Thing's is one of my favorite shows! It's fun, suspenseful, and the character's are all very interesting. I loved seasons one and three, two was alright, but wasn't as interesting as the others. I can't wait to see what season four will be like.",Positive
9,It is a great and very modern series. Definitely the best series right now (2020). The cast does a real great job (especially Winona Ryder) and it is getting better every season. Season 3 is by far the funniest and best season. This is a must watch!,Positive
9,"A friend recommended this series to me that it is said to be one of the best. Right after a few episodes, I fell in love with this series and it became my favorite. Excellent CGI, great performances by young actors, a wonderful soundtrack and above all the perfect atmosphere of the 80's make Stranger Things what it is. I love it and I can recommend it. Season 1 - 9,5/10 Season 2 - 9/10 Season 3 - 8,5/10 Season 4 - 9,5/10",Positive
9,I love very strange things. I started watching since the release of season 1. And I liked season 3 the most for its atmasphere and scenario.,Positive
8,One of the best shows on **** is incredibly entertaining and the performances are great. Final Grade: A-,Positive
8,Amazing characters and story that captured me from the first episode that made me binge watch the full 3 seasons on Netflix. I love all of the seasons but I kinda felt like season 3 fell short compared to the other two but it still kept me really entertained.,Positive

8,"it started very well, but it has been declining with the passing of the seasons, but maintaining an above average quality. It was the first Netflix series, so I have a huge affection for the first season that was the best so far!",Positive
9,"Great sci-fi adventure. In the first season, I thought that it seemed more like a drama but then you got to the finale and you got prepared for the rest of the show’s action packed episodes. The second season brings back the characters and puts them against a way bigger threat. And the third season... it’s just awesome. I can’t say much about it, because it is so freaking good",Positive

Characters are so well developed, the show just plays with your emotions and the Duffer brothers have created a unique blend of characters that are loved, excellent elements of comedy, friendship, childhood adventure, imagination, and of course mystery & horror.. Cinematography for season 3 was incredible, every episode felt like it was a Spielberg movie. Eye candy everywhere and not to mention the incredible little details, Episode 6-8 felt like I was on MDMA everything looked good.",Positive

10,"Review Of Stranger Things S1-S3 Stranger Things S1: Stranger Things S1 is only 3 years old but it already feels like a brilliant classic, the main focus is on the characters which inhabit this twisted yet beautiful fictional town, the show absolutely nails the 80s vibe, classic technology, adverts, architecture and cliches which were prominent at the time. It's got a dark and twisted narrative which manages to hook you after the second episode, a brilliant cast of characters which are all different, well realized and developed and above all a disturbing and somewhat scary antagonist. I wouldn't call Stranger Things (Season One) a horror per se, it's more of a psychological thriller/drama. On top of all this it has an amazing soundtrack, I listen to some of the tunes present in the show on the daily. Overall Stranger Things Season One is near perfect, it manages to nail pretty much everything important but in saying that it does do a few things wrong but overall 8.7/10. Stranger Things S2: The second season is my personal favorite, it once again manages to nail everything the first season did and improve on some things the first season did wrong, character development hits an all time high in this season, relationships that were already established previously are deepened, the performances given by the actors and actresses this time around are a lot more believable as the kids have matured since the previous season. The new additions to the cast are also A+. The stakes are a lot higher in this season although the antagonist isn't as intimidating this time around. I only had one issue with this season, S2 E7 is so out of place and downright boring at times, it completely deviates from the source material and ends up becoming a chore to watch, it feels like a set up for a potential spin off or movie. You could skip E7 and not miss out on any vital information but once this episode is over the brilliance returns. I felt quite satisfied by the time the credits rolled, another solid season. Overall Stranger Things Season Two is an improvement over it's predecessor, 9.5/10. Stranger Things S3: The third season of this brilliant show is once again another solid season but it has some issues. I watched Season 3 twice just to make sure my thoughts and opinions were justified. Season Three doesn't feel like a step forward or back, I say this because it's on par with the previous two seasons but it doesn't improve upon anything. The acting once again was solid and believable, the chemistry between these actors is visible on screen and I feel it adds an extra layer of believability to the show. At this point you care about all of these characters and their relationships, this season explores teen romance and the drama that comes along with it. This is definitely the funniest season of the three, almost all of the jokes land and it feels a lot more lighthearted than the previous two seasons. There are once again new additions to the cast which are once again all brilliant. Now lets get into the negatives, I personally found this season to be a bit of a drag for a while, it has some really bad pacing issues and sub plots that don't lead anywhere. The season starts of pretty strong, we're introduced to the gang again and this makes for some childish fun but as soon as E2 ends, things go South for a bit. It slows down drastically from E3, there are some unnecessary sub plots which don't really make sense and don't lead anywhere, scenes drag on and on because it lacks the same mysterious and disturbing vibe the previous seasons had. The narrative is a mess from E3-E5, things don't make sense, characters are split up into duos and trios and it takes too many liberties, it relies on the fact that you care about these characters rather than telling a cohesive and immersive story. It gets way too unrealistic too, the previous two seasons always felt grounded and believable but this season feels like more of a cartoon than anything else. I didn't feel immersed in the narrative until the final two episodes, there weren't any heart racing moments like the previous two seasons either. It starts picking up the pace after E5 and it makes a huge comeback. Episodes 6,7,8 contain some of the best moments in the entire show, the stakes are raised, the tension builds and you're immersed once again. E7 and E8 are absolutely brilliant, easily the best two episodes in the show. E8 in particular was a masterpiece, everything starts to make sense, the tension goes through the roof and it feels realistic again. I can't express my true views on this episode in writing but I can tell you, it was simply breathtaking. Overall Stranger Things Season Three suffers from slow pacing for a few episodes but as soon as you're ready to find something else to watch it reels you in for an amazing finale. As a result this season's saving grace is it's finale, 10/10 purely because of the brilliant finale. Stranger Things S1, S2 & S3: 9.8/10",Positive
10,This is the best TV show on earth. It builds up slowly but methodically to expand over several seasons. I was amazed with the storytelling. Every piece slowly falls into place to create a grand finale that will be mastered to blow your mind away...,Positive
10,"This serie is so incredible and perfect, when a i see for the first time i stay like ""OH MY GOD""",Positive
10,This is literally the best show ever. Season Three left me in tears of shock thanks to one of the saddest endings of all time (probably in second place after I Am Legend). There is literally no show that I would rather watch than this.,Positive
8,great characters and a welcome throw back to the 80’s pop culture. Season 3 showed signs of fatigue and lack of originality.,Positive
8,"Is great show , every season is better and better i love it so much In season 3. Dustin , steve and robin are the best and maybe Érica too but in a low importante role",Positive
10,"Must watch for sure. If you like Sci-Fi, Old 20th century style or mystery / horror, you’re guaranteed to enjoy these series.",Positive
10,"The magic might be gone but the nostalgia that it has sought to exploit since the first season is still very much present. Objectively, there are better shows out there. However, if you were in love with the first season, Season 3 will feel like a test. For me, it was passed successfully. There is no middle ground here. The relationship I have with the show might be a bit wobblier but that's just the end of the honeymoon phase. The love remains real. A show for the ages, there is no doubt about that.",Positive
10,"Awesome show!!! All the 80s you can handle and monsters, what's not to love! Hopper is a great flawed hero, he takes his lumps and keeps on fighting and Joyce is a headstrong out of the box thinking perfect counterpart to Hop. Everyone brings there own set of skills and flaws which ultimately make everyone very human and understandable/relatable. Great action, great humor, edge of your seat moments and heart tugs is what you get with this one... DON'T MISS IT!!!",Positive
10,After seeing this whole season. I have to say. This was the best Season yet. Glad I saw this one.,Positive
10,"I absolutely hate that Netflix is taking out all the cigarette smoking in the shows. Like what the hell in the 80s everyone used to smoke, it’s what put the show together. It’s relatable to some older people. Yes smoking is bad but honestly so many people are so sensitive now. Grow a pair and if you don’t like it then move tf on",Positive
9,"How a show gets better as it goes on is amazing to me. The season seems to culminate ideas from The Thing, Terminator and even Red Dawn. Overall a must-watch for the summer.",Positive
9,"Alot better than season 2, very nice, very good, very spicy and oh so nicey",Positive
9,"The best season so far, with an amazing attention to detail that is the perfect gestalt of a 80's action movie.",Positive
9,"Season three ratchets up all of the things about the show that we love. I think in furthering the character development, a few of our beloved characters get a little lost in the shuffle. I’m talking about you Jim Hopper! For the most part though, all of our terror and anxiety is amped up through the incredible work done by Dacre Montgomery as Billy. His sings with Millie Bobby Brown as Eleven are especially intense and at times heartfelt. Our supporting cast is there in ways that we haven’t seen before and we get new and interesting groups that are both funny and touching. This season doesn’t disappoint and only makes you want season for all the more.",Positive
8,"Excellent first season, Nice second season, Bad final season. It is an amazing sci-fi story, and you really start to care about the characters, but at the end, it fails to develop some characters and keep using some that aren't even relevant.",Positive
10,[SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.],Positive
8,"+Excellent cast +Great cinematography +Noticably larger production value -Screenplay and characters feel contrived this time around Dont get me wrong, S3 is a very enjoyable and high quality outing but a few **** points stopped it from achieving perfection this time around... EG:-why is Joyce so intensly motivated to solve the disturbances? Why is hopper now a great number of IQ points lower than previous outings?? The motivations of the characters just feel too convenient and inserts for the sake of 'team up 80's style' moments and the various odd almost sketch like setups.. I miss those natural, slower paced moments of S1. Nonetheless STS3 is one heck of a show to watch in 2019.",Positive
10,A classic nostalgic feel and expert character building Stranger Things is a brilliant show. It is amazing!,Positive
10,Amazing! Breathtaking! This may just be the best show on Netflix. Everything about the show is perfect. You must to watch it.,Positive
10,"Breathtaking! This may just be the best show on Netflix. Everything is fantastic. The show is set in the 1980's, and that works well with the plot devices and really makes the show possible. The characters on this show are very well fleshed out, and they all feel like real people, even minor characters that are only present in 1 or 2 scenes. The pacing on the show is also fantastic. The show only tells the viewer little bits of information, enough that they know what is going on, but not too much that it just gives away the answers. This keeps the show interesting. The acting is great too... You have to watch it!",Positive
10,"By far the best season. The characters emotions felt real, it was horrorfying in all the right ways. I came out of watching this season excited for season 4. The actors are phenomanal. Character Arcs from season 1 and 2 end in the best way possible. It felt like an extension of the series making ever so more powerful. I do wish we saw nancy be a bit more useful, otherwise great show, a definite must watch!",Positive
8,"Hawkins, Indiana faces a familiar but more lethal threat this time around as Soviet forces are attempting to bring back the alien life forms to use as weapons. Eleven, Mike, Will and the rest of the gang come together once again to get rid of this threat once and for all. Millie Bobby Brown is a STAR. I have said that before but I really believe it now. She has put a stamp on her future after three strong seasons of this series and I cannot wait to see what she does for the big screen (and hopefully she gets casted in better films than Godzilla: King of the Monsters). I don’t have to mention this but of course Winona Ryder and David Harbour provide great performances per usual but the surprise standout has to be Priah Ferguson who portrays Erica (Lucas’ little sister). She was sampled a little bit in season 2 and I guess the filmmakers answered our requests that she gets a lot more screen time. And I’m glad to say she becomes part of the main cast and she had me laughing after every line of dialogue. We all should come to know that Stranger Things always gives us great, clever writing with a really good suspense/thriller story. This season probably provides my favorite story as we finally move away from Will being the constant host of the “Demagorgons” and the stakes become much higher and grand. And as time in this series progresses, obviously our core cast of teens are aging. They aren’t kids anymore so there are some realistic aspects thrown in on some of them getting into their first relationship and others feeling left out and pushed to the side. Very relatable to us all whether we feel on either spectrum. Our main cast splits into four different story lines and I was invested into all of them for the most part. I will not lie that it took me a couple episodes to really get going into the story line that involves Chief Hopper and Joyce Byers. But as their story progresses, I couldn’t help but to love the outcome. This specific season most likely ends off on the most emotional note compared to the previous two. And that is not possible without the great writing and character development that the Duffer Brothers seem to give the main cast. And I absolutely adored the setting of this series as it takes place around and on July 4th. The set design and cinematography is so colorful and vibrant and the last two seasons do not match up to this third season as far as looks go. I have to sleep on this third season a bit before I say that it is my favorite but just the fact that I am thinking about it... definitely means you all will enjoy this new installment of Stranger Things. Happy binging!!!",Positive
9,"Best show on Netflix. Amazing characters, they are all built with a inusual kind of precision for a TVshow. The Seasons are always better and the story works very well in all the details. Something special with a perfect, young cast. Scare, fun and a little bit of drama make Stranger Things a masterpiece!",Positive

10,"One of the best seasons I have ever seen. its filled with amazing moments,some of the most scariest Scenes I have ever seen and also one of the best villains yet in vecna.",Positive
8,"This is a tough one, now I watched Seasons 1 - 4, I binged the living **** out of it, and I gotta say, I never thought I'd like this. I'm very happy that I caught this series just in time for next year. So this series is an 8/10 because it suffers from some incorrect scientific fiction. The other thing is that the characters in most cases are incredibly stupid, especially in season 4 where it's noticeable. The writers struggled with Seasons 3 - 4 because they forgot certain logic that was explained in S1 - 2. I can only hope they rewatch what they made for S5, because if it continues with the same writing from S4, then oh boy we have a Game of Thrones Situation coming. Anyway, the way this Series is composed with its cinematography characters and Cool and Fun Sci-fi, it's **** far.",Positive
9,[SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.],Positive
10,"I still have no idea how they do it, but somehow they manage to keep the series going and that each time it goes up a level more than the previous one, without a doubt it’s a good series that everyone should watch.",Positive

8,"Very nice tv show , so excited of 5 season, can't wait, actually one of my favorite tv show ever. 8,5/10 solid",Positive
9,"Is Stranger Things actually worth watching? Stranger things - it’s a science fiction horror drama. Moreover, it involves the topics such as love, friendship, school issues and so on. This TV series is about a group of teenagers who is trying to save their town by fighting horrific monsters. The plot is super unique, the scenes are thrilling and the character development is amazing. The directors, The Duffer Brothers, have come up with a brilliant idea for the series. They have managed to create a TV show for people of all ages. The Stranger things series has four seasons. The fifth one will come out at the end of 2025 year. Each season consists of 8-11 episodes. The actors’ cast has been selected correctly. Every actor suits its character. That helps you to immerse yourself in the theme of the series. The single disadvantage is about the episode release time. Fans always have to wait about 2-3 years to watch a new season. It’s too long, because with the passage of time, you start to forget last episodes, so you have to rewatch the TV show to recall the details in your memory. In general, it’s the best way to spend your free time with pleasure watching something interesting. Try to offer it to your family and friends. They’ll like your idea.",Positive
8,Stranger things is a good show for me and I can't wait for the fifth season,Positive
7,It's very good for the first few seasons after that I kinda feel like it over stays It's welcome,Positive
10,"A series that contains everything to be good, script, soundtrack that fits perfectly at the right moments, charismatic characters, actors who were born to play their roles and a wonderful direction, one of the greatest series ever made in humanity and that marked and will mark many people still.",Positive
10,"""Stranger Things"" is a thrilling nostalgia trip for anyone who grew up in the 80s. The show's homage to classics like A Nightmare on Elm Street and Aliens is a delightful treat for fans of that era. The authentic 80s pop culture references and the well-crafted storyline make it a must-watch. It brilliantly captures the essence of the time, taking us on a suspenseful and heartwarming journey. A nostalgic masterpiece!",Positive

8,"I love this show and its thorough world building, I felt for every character that made me be on the edge of my seat when a point of tension was in the show. I could not part with any of them, but the most recent season I felt unsatisfied. There can be such a thing as too much character development or focus. The show has been slowly widening the scope, leaving Hawkins and introducing International players. Yet I feel that the show is too scared to depart from our group of kids and venture into the world it has created. The military, governments, nations are involved, its a avengers level threat yet I feel that the world doesn't care. Here we are at the end of the world potentially but everyone is smiling and going about their day. I hope that we get to see a big face off between the government/world against the invading dimension. I hope the scope of the show widens past our small group of kids from Hawkins.",Positive
10,"A detective horror story set in the 80s, full of nostalgic throwbacks and a childish fun sense of humor. 10/10 because stranger things has executed exactly what it set out to do and its done so splendidly!",Positive
10,Very good. Amazing story whith very well written Characters and cool Monsters.,Positive

10,"Great show. I really struggle to commit to an entire series yet this show has totally broke the barrier. I absolutely loved this show due to its plot, sound track, and overall premise. This show has a great uniqueness to it, and has been well loved by teens to adults. This show is so well coordinated together. I watched it in under 2 weeks, and considering the fact I’m never able to commit to a show, like I’ve said, this was completely ironic. If you’re looking for a review to change your opinion on whether you should watch it or not because maybe you feel it’s too overrated, make this review the game changer. Great job, Duffer Brothers!",Positive
10,The BEST series I have see for a long time. I like the atmosphere the cast.,Positive
10,The series which never be unseccesful. And 4th season is the best season so far because we can see hole story clearly. Netflix is earning earning money because of this!,Positive
7,Enjoyable show. Season 1 and 4 are particular strong. 2 and 3 are decent. Great horror and drama elements.,Positive
8,"Season 1 : 8,2 At it's core, Stranger Things is a Redemption Story. It's excels in the term of fleshing out all of their character (even the one we didn't see often). Everyone has its flaws, and everyone trying to be better because of it. And through this ""Stranges"" event",Positive
10,"What makes a tv show interesting is very important for the audience. The audience must stay focused and enjoy the tv show the whole time. Quality, characters, story, and entertainment are the best parts of this tv show, which are very important for the audiences and the fans. To start with, the quality of the tv show is top-rated, which means the scenes, clothes, and location is perfectly designed, and it doesn't change over time. For a Tv show, it is essential to stay committed to the first season, which means if it starts excellent, the audience expects it to keep up the same and not change. Stranger things start with exceptional quality and stay the same over time. Characters are always essential in all movies, TV shows, and stranger things have the best characters you can ever imagine. It takes only one episode to fall in love with these beautiful characters and relate to them until the end. At first, you might see them as ""kids,"" but as soon as you see the first episode, you will know this is not a kid's show and is far more interesting than that. The love these kids give to their characters is far greater than their ""roles,"" and this is something it makes this tv show very unique. From seasons one to four, you will see many changes in the characters and environment, but this change is not bad. The characters develop more and grow up, which is very important for what comes next. The writer will add many new characters to the show, which is always reasonable and necessary for the main characters to develop more and get more power using their team. The storyline is far from unique. It stays interesting every minute and makes you wonder what will happen next. The storyline is about two different worlds and how they met. The characters are doing a great job, and they grow up with the storyline, which makes the tv show and the storyline more believable. The storyline keeps getting stronger and more powerful after each episode, and at some point, you feel like you can't stop watching and Entertainment is one of the most outstanding qualities of this amazing tv show. Once you start watching this tv show, there is no going back, and you will not regret it. The tv show will keep you wondering while answering all of your questions about the environment, characters, and even storyline. Netflix has done a great job creating this unique and memorable tv show. One of the good things about this tv show for me was the 1980s environment and how good and comfortable the cast created every moment with tiny details and love.",Positive

10,"This is my favorite show of all time! I highly recommend watching it, it’s really thrilling, but is a little scary.",Positive
10,wow this was amazing ... thank you sooo much for such an epic season... best one so far,Positive
10,"Stranger Things is my personal most favourite show of all time ,I remember starting the show early 2017 and was so invested in the characters and plot that it just made me binge through 2 seasons in a day. Stranger Things is the type of show to just progress and get better each season and now that Stranger Things 4 is out I have no words to describe how i felt about this season,but i can say that it is definitely the best season yet.",Positive
10,"This show is fantastic. The cast is great, the story is well-told, and there are very few things that I would change to make the show better.",Positive
10,Absolute must-see television. The Duffer Brothers knock it out of the park for what I believe is the series' best season so far. There are so many twists and turns and it had me on the edge of my seat the whole time. This is one of the most addicting series that I have ever watched.

8,"Having heard nearly nothing but good, actually great, things about 'Stranger Things', despite it attracting some criticism (like a lot of popular shows do these days, interest was high watching it. Due to being so intrigued by its concept and various ideas and tones. 'Stranger Things' on the most part is deserving of the love it has, for me its lack of originality was not a problem because it executes so much of everything else so wonderfully. It is not perfect and not an even in quality show, but when it was good, as shown in a quite excellent first season, boy was it more than great. Along with 'The Crown' and 'House of Cards' in its prime, 'Stranger Things' is one of the best Netflix has done and in well above their general standard. Do agree absolutely that Season 2 is not near as good as Season 1. There are still a lot of elements present in Season 2 that was especially good about the first season and part of the show's appeal, but somehow the writing didn't always feel as tight, focused or rounded and some of it was a bit forced and obvious. Also felt some of the effects weren't as refined either. While the acting is great from almost all the cast, Winona Ryder's melodramatic over-acting did feel at odds with everything else. Everything else is executed so well. A vast majority of the time, apart from the lack of refinement of some of the effect in the second season, the production values are just great. Very stylish and atmospheric, with some truly beautiful images that one can't believe such high quality comes from a Netflix show. The music is haunting and nostalgic. Writing is thought probing and has a lot of brains and heart, with some nice gentle humour that doesn't overpower, some truly poignant drama and tension. The story is rich in atmosphere and even though the story ideas are not original and have been understandably described as derivative, it's the execution and telling of these ideas that makes one look past that. The suspenseful mystery elements, the inventive and intriguing sci-fi elements and dark and disturbing horror elements are beautifully balanced and handled adeptly on their own. With an emotional core and nostalgic homages added as well. Characters are compelling and it's the chemistry and interaction and how the relationships are written that makes 'Stranger Things' work so well. Excepting Ryder, the acting is terrific. The standouts being Finn Wolfhard and particularly Millie Bobby Brown (such an expressive actress in a beyond-her-years subtle way), if they continue to act this way and be wise with their career choices they are very likely to have big careers. Overall, very good show and at its best excellent. Do wish that Season 2 was as good as the first though. 8/10 Bethany Cox",Positive
10,"Watched over the last few weeks and I can't believe that I slept through it and where does the good children's drama come from all of a sudden? Even something like ES was really good in this respect. Inspiring, grandiose and incredibly exciting from start to finish. Stranger Things as a mix of thriller, mystery and drama delivers on an incredibly good level and has catapulted itself directly to the most popular series with my girlfriend and me. Hopper is the pillar and superbly characterized and acted. Otherwise, the development of all other characters or newly added figures is absolutely coherent and meaningfully woven into the series. Harrington e.g. is going through a really strong development. Likewise, the story, which is often told on different levels, is so well connected that each merging of the individual strands never seems superimposed, but fits completely organically into the narrative and everything follows a common thread. It then jumps again and again between the individual stories, but they are absolutely exciting on their own and then lead to a really satisfying result. We are absolutely thrilled and can't wait for Season 4. I actually never had the feeling that I was watching a bad episode, only one or the other scene was a bit lengthy. By the way, the effects are exceptionally well done and it definitely has its spooky moments. Absolutely recommendable (if someone still lives behind the moon).",Positive
9,"The drama, the story, the narrative and the development of all the characters are an example for several current series of the same genre. The biggest positive point, besides the drama, is that the development of all the characters doesn't take that long and, even so, it delivers a good result.",Positive
10,"One of the best series of all time, the greatest Netflix Production's creation",Positive
9,"I have watched this 3 or 4 times completely. That speaks for itself :D. In my opinion the third season was the best, then the first and the second was the worst.",Positive
10,"Hi, I am from India(Tamilnadu), such a wonderful series. But please let hopper live somewhere and be back at the next episode, please. The only thing that hurt us is that hopper's loss. he is the man of the match.",Positive
10,"Stranger Things as a whole is one of the best shows I have seen so far. All three seasons have been exciting and stunning, from the visuals to the acting and the music. My only wish is that they dont overproduce it in the following seasons 4 (and possibly 5) but give it a good and worthy ending.",Positive
10,"The greatest TV show of all time. Amazing and engaging characters with so much depth, an amazing story that's like a remix of the best parts of the 80s, amazing original 80s synth based music, outstanding visuals, perfect horror atmosphere...everything is just perfect.",Positive
10,"Now that Game of Thrones is over, can we all collectively agree that this is the show that we all watch and discuss with each other?",Positive
10,The BEST Netflix Original Series ever made! I cannot even begin to explain how insanely good this TV Show is...This show has everything...A brilliant story with loveable characters and some fantastic homages and tributes to the old sci fi/horror movies and tv shows of the late 70s and 80s. A full nostalgia trip which makes it feel so fresh and new. If you have a Netflix **** yourself a favor and give yourself some time to watch this from start to finish! Bring on Season 4!,Positive
9,If I am going to be completely honest. This has to be the best Netflix original. Binge-watching every season and knowing each episode is an adventure in itself is amazing,Positive

9,Went to this page just to dislike every negative review. The show is good! Whoever made a negative review is a monster.,Positive
10,"Extremely retro style in the 1980s with Stephen King's supernatural terror and detective plot foreshadowing method, the compact plot is like a super long film, the wonderful performances of child stars are especially added, the screen style of neon lights is integrated with the background music of retro pop music, and the carnival of supernatural fans, Cthulhu fans and conspiracy theory guys, this is probably one of the best ways to experience Hollywood in the summer of 1980s.",Positive
10,"Stranger Thing's is one of my favorite shows! It's fun, suspenseful, and the character's are all very interesting. I loved seasons one and three, two was alright, but wasn't as interesting as the others. I can't wait to see what season four will be like.",Positive
9,It is a great and very modern series. Definitely the best series right now (2020). The cast does a real great job (especially Winona Ryder) and it is getting better every season. Season 3 is by far the funniest and best season. This is a must watch!,Positive
9,"A friend recommended this series to me that it is said to be one of the best. Right after a few episodes, I fell in love with this series and it became my favorite. Excellent CGI, great performances by young actors, a wonderful soundtrack and above all the perfect atmosphere of the 80's make Stranger Things what it is. I love it and I can recommend it. Season 1 - 9,5/10 Season 2 - 9/10 Season 3 - 8,5/10 Season 4 - 9,5/10",Positive
9,I love very strange things. I started watching since the release of season 1. And I liked season 3 the most for its atmasphere and scenario.,Positive
8,One of the best shows on **** is incredibly entertaining and the performances are great. Final Grade: A-,Positive
8,Amazing characters and story that captured me from the first episode that made me binge watch the full 3 seasons on Netflix. I love all of the seasons but I kinda felt like season 3 fell short compared to the other two but it still kept me really entertained.,Positive
9,The first and third season of this show are 10/10 but the second season isn't nearly as good. It is my favorite show of all time.,Positive

8,"it started very well, but it has been declining with the passing of the seasons, but maintaining an above average quality. It was the first Netflix series, so I have a huge affection for the first season that was the best so far!",Positive
9,"Great sci-fi adventure. In the first season, I thought that it seemed more like a drama but then you got to the finale and you got prepared for the rest of the show’s action packed episodes. The second season brings back the characters and puts them against a way bigger threat. And the third season... it’s just awesome. I can’t say much about it, because it is so freaking good",Positive

10,"Anyone in need of some Nostalgia candy?, step right up... This show was good. Season 1 was ok, season 2 was very good TV. Season 3 however is a must watch. Characters are so well developed, the show just plays with your emotions and the Duffer brothers have created a unique blend of characters that are loved, excellent elements of comedy, friendship, childhood adventure, imagination, and of course mystery & horror.. Cinematography for season 3 was incredible, every episode felt like it was a Spielberg movie. Eye candy everywhere and not to mention the incredible little details, Episode 6-8 felt like I was on MDMA everything looked good.",Positive

10,"Review Of Stranger Things S1-S3 Stranger Things S1: Stranger Things S1 is only 3 years old but it already feels like a brilliant classic, the main focus is on the characters which inhabit this twisted yet beautiful fictional town, the show absolutely nails the 80s vibe, classic technology, adverts, architecture and cliches which were prominent at the time. It's got a dark and twisted narrative which manages to hook you after the second episode, a brilliant cast of characters which are all different, well realized and developed and above all a disturbing and somewhat scary antagonist. I wouldn't call Stranger Things (Season One) a horror per se, it's more of a psychological thriller/drama. On top of all this it has an amazing soundtrack, I listen to some of the tunes present in the show on the daily. Overall Stranger Things Season One is near perfect, it manages to nail pretty much everything important but in saying that it does do a few things wrong but overall 8.7/10. Stranger Things S2: The second season is my personal favorite, it once again manages to nail everything the first season did and improve on some things the first season did wrong, character development hits an all time high in this season, relationships that were already established previously are deepened, the performances given by the actors and actresses this time around are a lot more believable as the kids have matured since the previous season. The new additions to the cast are also A+. The stakes are a lot higher in this season although the antagonist isn't as intimidating this time around. I only had one issue with this season, S2 E7 is so out of place and downright boring at times, it completely deviates from the source material and ends up becoming a chore to watch, it feels like a set up for a potential spin off or movie. You could skip E7 and not miss out on any vital information but once this episode is over the brilliance returns. I felt quite satisfied by the time the credits rolled, another solid season. Overall Stranger Things Season Two is an improvement over it's predecessor, 9.5/10. Stranger Things S3: The third season of this brilliant show is once again another solid season but it has some issues. I watched Season 3 twice just to make sure my thoughts and opinions were justified. Season Three doesn't feel like a step forward or back, I say this because it's on par with the previous two seasons but it doesn't improve upon anything. The acting once again was solid and believable, the chemistry between these actors is visible on screen and I feel it adds an extra layer of believability to the show. At this point you care about all of these characters and their relationships, this season explores teen romance and the drama that comes along with it. This is definitely the funniest season of the three, almost all of the jokes land and it feels a lot more lighthearted than the previous two seasons. There are once again new additions to the cast which are once again all brilliant. Now lets get into the negatives, I personally found this season to be a bit of a drag for a while, it has some really bad pacing issues and sub plots that don't lead anywhere. The season starts of pretty strong, we're introduced to the gang again and this makes for some childish fun but as soon as E2 ends, things go South for a bit. It slows down drastically from E3, there are some unnecessary sub plots which don't really make sense and don't lead anywhere, scenes drag on and on because it lacks the same mysterious and disturbing vibe the previous seasons had. The narrative is a mess from E3-E5, things don't make sense, characters are split up into duos and trios and it takes too many liberties, it relies on the fact that you care about these characters rather than telling a cohesive and immersive story. It gets way too unrealistic too, the previous two seasons always felt grounded and believable but this season feels like more of a cartoon than anything else. I didn't feel immersed in the narrative until the final two episodes, there weren't any heart racing moments like the previous two seasons either. It starts picking up the pace after E5 and it makes a huge comeback. Episodes 6,7,8 contain some of the best moments in the entire show, the stakes are raised, the tension builds and you're immersed once again. E7 and E8 are absolutely brilliant, easily the best two episodes in the show. E8 in particular was a masterpiece, everything starts to make sense, the tension goes through the roof and it feels realistic again. I can't express my true views on this episode in writing but I can tell you, it was simply breathtaking. Overall Stranger Things Season Three suffers from slow pacing for a few episodes but as soon as you're ready to find something else to watch it reels you in for an amazing finale. As a result this season's saving grace is it's finale, 10/10 purely because of the brilliant finale. Stranger Things S1, S2 & S3: 9.8/10",Positive
10,This is the best TV show on earth. It builds up slowly but methodically to expand over several seasons. I was amazed with the storytelling. Every piece slowly falls into place to create a grand finale that will be mastered to blow your mind away...,Positive
10,"This serie is so incredible and perfect, when a i see for the first time i stay like ""OH MY GOD""",Positive
10,This is literally the best show ever. Season Three left me in tears of shock thanks to one of the saddest endings of all time (probably in second place after I Am Legend). There is literally no show that I would rather watch than this.,Positive
8,great characters and a welcome throw back to the 80’s pop culture. Season 3 showed signs of fatigue and lack of originality.,Positive
8,"Is great show , every season is better and better i love it so much In season 3. Dustin , steve and robin are the best and maybe Érica too but in a low importante role",Positive
10,"Must watch for sure. If you like Sci-Fi, Old 20th century style or mystery / horror, you’re guaranteed to enjoy these series.",Positive
10,"The magic might be gone but the nostalgia that it has sought to exploit since the first season is still very much present. Objectively, there are better shows out there. However, if you were in love with the first season, Season 3 will feel like a test. For me, it was passed successfully. There is no middle ground here. The relationship I have with the show might be a bit wobblier but that's just the end of the honeymoon phase. The love remains real. A show for the ages, there is no doubt about that.",Positive
10,"Awesome show!!! All the 80s you can handle and monsters, what's not to love! Hopper is a great flawed hero, he takes his lumps and keeps on fighting and Joyce is a headstrong out of the box thinking perfect counterpart to Hop. Everyone brings there own set of skills and flaws which ultimately make everyone very human and understandable/relatable. Great action, great humor, edge of your seat moments and heart tugs is what you get with this one... DON'T MISS IT!!!",Positive
10,After seeing this whole season. I have to say. This was the best Season yet. Glad I saw this one.,Positive
10,"I absolutely hate that Netflix is taking out all the cigarette smoking in the shows. Like what the hell in the 80s everyone used to smoke, it’s what put the show together. It’s relatable to some older people. Yes smoking is bad but honestly so many people are so sensitive now. Grow a pair and if you don’t like it then move tf on",Positive
9,"How a show gets better as it goes on is amazing to me. The season seems to culminate ideas from The Thing, Terminator and even Red Dawn. Overall a must-watch for the summer.",Positive
9,"Alot better than season 2, very nice, very good, very spicy and oh so nicey",Positive
9,"The best season so far, with an amazing attention to detail that is the perfect gestalt of a 80's action movie.",Positive
9,"Season three ratchets up all of the things about the show that we love. I think in furthering the character development, a few of our beloved characters get a little lost in the shuffle. I’m talking about you Jim Hopper! For the most part though, all of our terror and anxiety is amped up through the incredible work done by Dacre Montgomery as Billy. His sings with Millie Bobby Brown as Eleven are especially intense and at times heartfelt. Our supporting cast is there in ways that we haven’t seen before and we get new and interesting groups that are both funny and touching. This season doesn’t disappoint and only makes you want season for all the more.",Positive
8,"Excellent first season, Nice second season, Bad final season. It is an amazing sci-fi story, and you really start to care about the characters, but at the end, it fails to develop some characters and keep using some that aren't even relevant.",Positive
10,[SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.],Positive
8,"+Excellent cast +Great cinematography +Noticably larger production value -Screenplay and characters feel contrived this time around Dont get me wrong, S3 is a very enjoyable and high quality outing but a few **** points stopped it from achieving perfection this time around... EG:-why is Joyce so intensly motivated to solve the disturbances? Why is hopper now a great number of IQ points lower than previous outings?? The motivations of the characters just feel too convenient and inserts for the sake of 'team up 80's style' moments and the various odd almost sketch like setups.. I miss those natural, slower paced moments of S1. Nonetheless STS3 is one heck of a show to watch in 2019.",Positive
10,A classic nostalgic feel and expert character building Stranger Things is a brilliant show. It is amazing!,Positive
10,Amazing! Breathtaking! This may just be the best show on Netflix. Everything about the show is perfect. You must to watch it.,Positive
10,"Breathtaking! This may just be the best show on Netflix. Everything is fantastic. The show is set in the 1980's, and that works well with the plot devices and really makes the show possible. The characters on this show are very well fleshed out, and they all feel like real people, even minor characters that are only present in 1 or 2 scenes. The pacing on the show is also fantastic. The show only tells the viewer little bits of information, enough that they know what is going on, but not too much that it just gives away the answers. This keeps the show interesting. The acting is great too... You have to watch it!",Positive
10,"By far the best season. The characters emotions felt real, it was horrorfying in all the right ways. I came out of watching this season excited for season 4. The actors are phenomanal. Character Arcs from season 1 and 2 end in the best way possible. It felt like an extension of the series making ever so more powerful. I do wish we saw nancy be a bit more useful, otherwise great show, a definite must watch!",Positive
8,"Hawkins, Indiana faces a familiar but more lethal threat this time around as Soviet forces are attempting to bring back the alien life forms to use as weapons. Eleven, Mike, Will and the rest of the gang come together once again to get rid of this threat once and for all. Millie Bobby Brown is a STAR. I have said that before but I really believe it now. She has put a stamp on her future after three strong seasons of this series and I cannot wait to see what she does for the big screen (and hopefully she gets casted in better films than Godzilla: King of the Monsters). I don’t have to mention this but of course Winona Ryder and David Harbour provide great performances per usual but the surprise standout has to be Priah Ferguson who portrays Erica (Lucas’ little sister). She was sampled a little bit in season 2 and I guess the filmmakers answered our requests that she gets a lot more screen time. And I’m glad to say she becomes part of the main cast and she had me laughing after every line of dialogue. We all should come to know that Stranger Things always gives us great, clever writing with a really good suspense/thriller story. This season probably provides my favorite story as we finally move away from Will being the constant host of the “Demagorgons” and the stakes become much higher and grand. And as time in this series progresses, obviously our core cast of teens are aging. They aren’t kids anymore so there are some realistic aspects thrown in on some of them getting into their first relationship and others feeling left out and pushed to the side. Very relatable to us all whether we feel on either spectrum. Our main cast splits into four different story lines and I was invested into all of them for the most part. I will not lie that it took me a couple episodes to really get going into the story line that involves Chief Hopper and Joyce Byers. But as their story progresses, I couldn’t help but to love the outcome. This specific season most likely ends off on the most emotional note compared to the previous two. And that is not possible without the great writing and character development that the Duffer Brothers seem to give the main cast. And I absolutely adored the setting of this series as it takes place around and on July 4th. The set design and cinematography is so colorful and vibrant and the last two seasons do not match up to this third season as far as looks go. I have to sleep on this third season a bit before I say that it is my favorite but just the fact that I am thinking about it... definitely means you all will enjoy this new installment of Stranger Things. Happy binging!!!",Positive
9,"Best show on Netflix. Amazing characters, they are all built with a inusual kind of precision for a TVshow. The Seasons are always better and the story works very well in all the details.

8,"This is a tough one, now I watched Seasons 1 - 4, I binged the living **** out of it, and I gotta say, I never thought I'd like this. I'm very happy that I caught this series just in time for next year. So this series is an 8/10 because it suffers from some incorrect scientific fiction. The other thing is that the characters in most cases are incredibly stupid, especially in season 4 where it's noticeable. The writers struggled with Seasons 3 - 4 because they forgot certain logic that was explained in S1 - 2. I can only hope they rewatch what they made for S5, because if it continues with the same writing from S4, then oh boy we have a Game of Thrones Situation coming. Anyway, the way this Series is composed with its cinematography characters and Cool and Fun Sci-fi, it's **** far.",Positive

9,"Is Stranger Things actually worth watching? Stranger things - it’s a science fiction horror drama. Moreover, it involves the topics such as love, friendship, school issues and so on. This TV series is about a group of teenagers who is trying to save their town by fighting horrific monsters. The plot is super unique, the scenes are thrilling and the character development is amazing. The directors, The Duffer Brothers, have come up with a brilliant idea for the series. They have managed to create a TV show for people of all ages. The Stranger things series has four seasons. The fifth one will come out at the end of 2025 year. Each season consists of 8-11 episodes. The actors’ cast has been selected correctly. Every actor suits its character. That helps you to immerse yourself in the theme of the series. The single disadvantage is about the episode release time. Fans always have to wait about 2-3 years to watch a new season. It’s too long, because with the passage of time, you start to forget last episodes, so you have to rewatch the TV show to recall the details in your memory. In general, it’s the best way to spend your free time with pleasure watching something interesting. Try to offer it to your family and friends. They’ll like your idea.",Positive

10,"""Stranger Things"" is a thrilling nostalgia trip for anyone who grew up in the 80s. The show's homage to classics like A Nightmare on Elm Street and Aliens is a delightful treat for fans of that era. The authentic 80s pop culture references and the well-crafted storyline make it a must-watch. It brilliantly captures the essence of the time, taking us on a suspenseful and heartwarming journey.

9,I love the characters so much! The storylines and characters are so fleshed out and watching it gets me emotional.,Positive
8,"I love this show and its thorough world building, I felt for every character that made me be on the edge of my seat when a point of tension was in the show. I could not part with any of them, but the most recent season I felt unsatisfied. There can be such a thing as too much character development or focus. The show has been slowly widening the scope, leaving Hawkins and introducing International players. Yet I feel that the show is too scared to depart from our group of kids and venture into the world it has created. The military, governments, nations are involved, its a avengers level threat yet I feel that the world doesn't care. Here we are at the end of the world potentially but everyone is smiling and going about their day. I hope that we get to see a big face off between the government/world against the invading dimension. I hope the scope of the show widens past our small group of kids from Hawkins.",Positive
10,"A detective horror story set in the 80s, full of nostalgic throwbacks and a childish fun sense of humor. 10/10 because stranger things has executed exactly what it set out to do and its done so splendidly!",Positive
10,Very good. Amazing story whith very well written Characters and cool Monsters.,Positive

10,"Great show. I really struggle to commit to an entire series yet this show has totally broke the barrier. I absolutely loved this show due to its plot, sound track, and overall premise. This show has a great uniqueness to it, and has been well loved by teens to adults. This show is so well coordinated together. I watched it in under 2 weeks, and considering the fact I’m never able to commit to a show, like I’ve said, this was completely ironic. If you’re looking for a review to change your opinion on whether you should watch it or not because maybe you feel it’s too overrated, make this review the game changer. Great job, Duffer Brothers!",Positive
10,The BEST series I have see for a long time. I like the atmosphere the cast.,Positive
10,The series which never be unseccesful. And 4th season is the best season so far because we can see hole story clearly. Netflix is earning earning money because of this!,Positive
7,Enjoyable show. Season 1 and 4 are particular strong. 2 and 3 are decent. Great horror and drama elements.,Positive
8,"Season 1 : 8,2 At it's core, Stranger Things is a Redemption Story. It's excels in the term of fleshing out all of their character (even the one we didn't see often). Everyone has its flaws, and everyone trying to be better because of it. And through this ""Stranges"" event",Positive
10,"What makes a tv show interesting is very important for the audience. The audience must stay focused and enjoy the tv show the whole time. Quality, characters, story, and entertainment are the best parts of this tv show, which are very important for the audiences and the fans. To start with, the quality of the tv show is top-rated, which means the scenes, clothes, and location is perfectly designed, and it doesn't change over time. For a Tv show, it is essential to stay committed to the first season, which means if it starts excellent, the audience expects it to keep up the same and not change. Stranger things start with exceptional quality and stay the same over time. Characters are always essential in all movies, TV shows, and stranger things have the best characters you can ever imagine. It takes only one episode to fall in love with these beautiful characters and relate to them until the end. At first, you might see them as ""kids,"" but as soon as you see the first episode, you will know this is not a kid's show and is far more interesting than that. The love these kids give to their characters is far greater than their ""roles,"" and this is something it makes this tv show very unique. From seasons one to four, you will see many changes in the characters and environment, but this change is not bad. The characters develop more and grow up, which is very important for what comes next. The writer will add many new characters to the show, which is always reasonable and necessary for the main characters to develop more and get more power using their team. The storyline is far from unique. It stays interesting every minute and makes you wonder what will happen next. The storyline is about two different worlds and how they met. The characters are doing a great job, and they grow up with the storyline, which makes the tv show and the storyline more believable. The storyline keeps getting stronger and more powerful after each episode, and at some point, you feel like you can't stop watching and Entertainment is one of the most outstanding qualities of this amazing tv show. Once you start watching this tv show, there is no going back, and you will not regret it. The tv show will keep you wondering while answering all of your questions about the environment, characters, and even storyline. Netflix has done a great job creating this unique and memorable tv show. One of the good things about this tv show for me was the 1980s environment and how good and comfortable the cast created every moment with tiny details and love.",Positive

10,"Stranger Things is my personal most favourite show of all time ,I remember starting the show early 2017 and was so invested in the characters and plot that it just made me binge through 2 seasons in a day. Stranger Things is the type of show to just progress and get better each season and now that Stranger Things 4 is out I have no words to describe how i felt about this season,but i can say that it is definitely the best season yet.",Positive
10,"This show is fantastic. The cast is great, the story is well-told, and there are very few things that I would change to make the show better.",Positive
10,Absolute must-see television. The Duffer Brothers knock it out of the park for what I believe is the series' best season so far. There are so many twists and turns and it had me on the edge of my seat the whole time. This is one of the most addicting series that I have ever watched. Season 4 Volume 1 exceeded my wildest expectations and I felt like it was a season that was exceptionally well written.,Positive

8,"Having heard nearly nothing but good, actually great, things about 'Stranger Things', despite it attracting some criticism (like a lot of popular shows do these days, interest was high watching it. Due to being so intrigued by its concept and various ideas and tones. 'Stranger Things' on the most part is deserving of the love it has, for me its lack of originality was not a problem because it executes so much of everything else so wonderfully. It is not perfect and not an even in quality show, but when it was good, as shown in a quite excellent first season, boy was it more than great. Along with 'The Crown' and 'House of Cards' in its prime, 'Stranger Things' is one of the best Netflix has done and in well above their general standard. Do agree absolutely that Season 2 is not near as good as Season 1. There are still a lot of elements present in Season 2 that was especially good about the first season and part of the show's appeal, but somehow the writing didn't always feel as tight, focused or rounded and some of it was a bit forced and obvious. Also felt some of the effects weren't as refined either. While the acting is great from almost all the cast, Winona Ryder's melodramatic over-acting did feel at odds with everything else. Everything else is executed so well. A vast majority of the time, apart from the lack of refinement of some of the effect in the second season, the production values are just great. Very stylish and atmospheric, with some truly beautiful images that one can't believe such high quality comes from a Netflix show. The music is haunting and nostalgic. Writing is thought probing and has a lot of brains and heart, with some nice gentle humour that doesn't overpower, some truly poignant drama and tension. The story is rich in atmosphere and even though the story ideas are not original and have been understandably described as derivative, it's the execution and telling of these ideas that makes one look past that. The suspenseful mystery elements, the inventive and intriguing sci-fi elements and dark and disturbing horror elements are beautifully balanced and handled adeptly on their own. With an emotional core and nostalgic homages added as well. Characters are compelling and it's the chemistry and interaction and how the relationships are written that makes 'Stranger Things' work so well. Excepting Ryder, the acting is terrific. The standouts being Finn Wolfhard and particularly Millie Bobby Brown (such an expressive actress in a beyond-her-years subtle way), if they continue to act this way and be wise with their career choices they are very likely to have big careers. Overall, very good show and at its best excellent. Do wish that Season 2 was as good as the first though. 8/10 Bethany Cox",Positive
10,"Watched over the last few weeks and I can't believe that I slept through it and where does the good children's drama come from all of a sudden? Even something like ES was really good in this respect. Inspiring, grandiose and incredibly exciting from start to finish. Stranger Things as a mix of thriller, mystery and drama delivers on an incredibly good level and has catapulted itself directly to the most popular series with my girlfriend and me. Hopper is the pillar and superbly characterized and acted. Otherwise, the development of all other characters or newly added figures is absolutely coherent and meaningfully woven into the series. Harrington e.g. is going through a really strong development. Likewise, the story, which is often told on different levels, is so well connected that each merging of the individual strands never seems superimposed, but fits completely organically into the narrative and everything follows a common thread. It then jumps again and again between the individual stories, but they are absolutely exciting on their own and then lead to a really satisfying result. We are absolutely thrilled and can't wait for Season 4. I actually never had the feeling that I was watching a bad episode, only one or the other scene was a bit lengthy. By the way, the effects are exceptionally well done and it definitely has its spooky moments. Absolutely recommendable (if someone still lives behind the moon).",Positive
9,"The drama, the story, the narrative and the development of all the characters are an example for several current series of the same genre. The biggest positive point, besides the drama, is that the development of all the characters doesn't take that long and, even so, it delivers a good result.",Positive
10,"One of the best series of all time, the greatest Netflix Production's creation",Positive
9,"I have watched this 3 or 4 times completely. That speaks for itself :D. In my opinion the third season was the best, then the first and the second was the worst.",Positive
10,"Hi, I am from India(Tamilnadu), such a wonderful series. But please let hopper live somewhere and be back at the next episode, please. The only thing that hurt us is that hopper's loss. he is the man of the match.",Positive
10,"Stranger Things as a whole is one of the best shows I have seen so far. All three seasons have been exciting and stunning, from the visuals to the acting and the music. My only wish is that they dont overproduce it in the following seasons 4 (and possibly 5) but give it a good and worthy ending.",Positive
10,"The greatest TV show of all time. Amazing and engaging characters with so much depth, an amazing story that's like a remix of the best parts of the 80s, amazing original 80s synth based music, outstanding visuals, perfect horror atmosphere...everything is just perfect.",Positive
10,"Now that Game of Thrones is over, can we all collectively agree that this is the show that we all watch and discuss with each other?",Positive
10,The BEST Netflix Original Series ever made! I cannot even begin to explain how insanely good this TV Show is...This show has everything...A brilliant story with loveable characters and some fantastic homages and tributes to the old sci fi/horror movies and tv shows of the late 70s and 80s. A full nostalgia trip which makes it feel so fresh and new. If you have a Netflix **** yourself a favor and give yourself some time to watch this from start to finish! Bring on Season 4!,Positive
9,If I am going to be completely honest. This has to be the best Netflix original. Binge-watching every season and knowing each episode is an adventure in itself is amazing,Positive

9,Went to this page just to dislike every negative review. The show is good! Whoever made a negative review is a monster.,Positive
10,"Extremely retro style in the 1980s with Stephen King's supernatural terror and detective plot foreshadowing method, the compact plot is like a super long film, the wonderful performances of child stars are especially added, the screen style of neon lights is integrated with the background music of retro pop music, and the carnival of supernatural fans, Cthulhu fans and conspiracy theory guys, this is probably one of the best ways to experience Hollywood in the summer of 1980s.",Positive
10,"Stranger Thing's is one of my favorite shows! It's fun, suspenseful, and the character's are all very interesting. I loved seasons one and three, two was alright, but wasn't as interesting as the others. I can't wait to see what season four will be like.",Positive
9,It is a great and very modern series. Definitely the best series right now (2020). The cast does a real great job (especially Winona Ryder) and it is getting better every season. Season 3 is by far the funniest and best season. This is a must watch!,Positive
9,"A friend recommended this series to me that it is said to be one of the best. Right after a few episodes, I fell in love with this series and it became my favorite. Excellent CGI, great performances by young actors, a wonderful soundtrack and above all the perfect atmosphere of the 80's make Stranger Things what it is. I love it and I can recommend it. Season 1 - 9,5/10 Season 2 - 9/10 Season 3 - 8,5/10 Season 4 - 9,5/10",Positive
9,I love very strange things. I started watching since the release of season 1. And I liked season 3 the most for its atmasphere and scenario.,Positive
8,One of the best shows on **** is incredibly entertaining and the performances are great. Final Grade: A-,Positive
8,Amazing characters and story that captured me from the first episode that made me binge watch the full 3 seasons on Netflix. I love all of the seasons but I kinda felt like season 3 fell short compared to the other two but it still kept me really entertained.,Positive

9,"Great sci-fi adventure. In the first season, I thought that it seemed more like a drama but then you got to the finale and you got prepared for the rest of the show’s action packed episodes. The second season brings back the characters and puts them against a way bigger threat. And the third season... it’s just awesome. I can’t say much about it, because it is so freaking good",Positive

Characters are so well developed, the show just plays with your emotions and the Duffer brothers have created a unique blend of characters that are loved, excellent elements of comedy, friendship, childhood adventure, imagination, and of course mystery & horror.. Cinematography for season 3 was incredible, every episode felt like it was a Spielberg movie.

10,"Review Of Stranger Things S1-S3 Stranger Things S1: Stranger Things S1 is only 3 years old but it already feels like a brilliant classic, the main focus is on the characters which inhabit this twisted yet beautiful fictional town, the show absolutely nails the 80s vibe, classic technology, adverts, architecture and cliches which were prominent at the time. It's got a dark and twisted narrative which manages to hook you after the second episode, a brilliant cast of characters which are all different, well realized and developed and above all a disturbing and somewhat scary antagonist. I wouldn't call Stranger Things (Season One) a horror per se, it's more of a psychological thriller/drama. On top of all this it has an amazing soundtrack, I listen to some of the tunes present in the show on the daily. Overall Stranger Things Season One is near perfect, it manages to nail pretty much everything important but in saying that it does do a few things wrong but overall 8.7/10. Stranger Things S2: The second season is my personal favorite, it once again manages to nail everything the first season did and improve on some things the first season did wrong, character development hits an all time high in this season, relationships that were already established previously are deepened, the performances given by the actors and actresses this time around are a lot more believable as the kids have matured since the previous season. The new additions to the cast are also A+. The stakes are a lot higher in this season although the antagonist isn't as intimidating this time around. I only had one issue with this season, S2 E7 is so out of place and downright boring at times, it completely deviates from the source material and ends up becoming a chore to watch, it feels like a set up for a potential spin off or movie. You could skip E7 and not miss out on any vital information but once this episode is over the brilliance returns. I felt quite satisfied by the time the credits rolled, another solid season. Overall Stranger Things Season Two is an improvement over it's predecessor, 9.5/10. Stranger Things S3: The third season of this brilliant show is once again another solid season but it has some issues. I watched Season 3 twice just to make sure my thoughts and opinions were justified. Season Three doesn't feel like a step forward or back, I say this because it's on par with the previous two seasons but it doesn't improve upon anything. The acting once again was solid and believable, the chemistry between these actors is visible on screen and I feel it adds an extra layer of believability to the show. At this point you care about all of these characters and their relationships, this season explores teen romance and the drama that comes along with it. This is definitely the funniest season of the three, almost all of the jokes land and it feels a lot more lighthearted than the previous two seasons. There are once again new additions to the cast which are once again all brilliant. Now lets get into the negatives, I personally found this season to be a bit of a drag for a while, it has some really bad pacing issues and sub plots that don't lead anywhere. The season starts of pretty strong, we're introduced to the gang again and this makes for some childish fun but as soon as E2 ends, things go South for a bit. It slows down drastically from E3, there are some unnecessary sub plots which don't really make sense and don't lead anywhere, scenes drag on and on because it lacks the same mysterious and disturbing vibe the previous seasons had. The narrative is a mess from E3-E5, things don't make sense, characters are split up into duos and trios and it takes too many liberties, it relies on the fact that you care about these characters rather than telling a cohesive and immersive story. It gets way too unrealistic too, the previous two seasons always felt grounded and believable but this season feels like more of a cartoon than anything else. I didn't feel immersed in the narrative until the final two episodes, there weren't any heart racing moments like the previous two seasons either. It starts picking up the pace after E5 and it makes a huge comeback. Episodes 6,7,8 contain some of the best moments in the entire show, the stakes are raised, the tension builds and you're immersed once again. E7 and E8 are absolutely brilliant, easily the best two episodes in the show. E8 in particular was a masterpiece, everything starts to make sense, the tension goes through the roof and it feels realistic again. I can't express my true views on this episode in writing but I can tell you, it was simply breathtaking. Overall Stranger Things Season Three suffers from slow pacing for a few episodes but as soon as you're ready to find something else to watch it reels you in for an amazing finale. As a result this season's saving grace is it's finale, 10/10 purely because of the brilliant finale. Stranger Things S1, S2 & S3: 9.8/10",Positive
10,This is the best TV show on earth. It builds up slowly but methodically to expand over several seasons. I was amazed with the storytelling. Every piece slowly falls into place to create a grand finale that will be mastered to blow your mind away...,Positive
10,"This serie is so incredible and perfect, when a i see for the first time i stay like ""OH MY GOD""",Positive
10,This is literally the best show ever. Season Three left me in tears of shock thanks to one of the saddest endings of all time (probably in second place after I Am Legend). There is literally no show that I would rather watch than this.,Positive
8,great characters and a welcome throw back to the 80’s pop culture. Season 3 showed signs of fatigue and lack of originality.,Positive
8,"Is great show , every season is better and better i love it so much In season 3. Dustin , steve and robin are the best and maybe Érica too but in a low importante role",Positive
10,"Must watch for sure. If you like Sci-Fi, Old 20th century style or mystery / horror, you’re guaranteed to enjoy these series.",Positive
10,"The magic might be gone but the nostalgia that it has sought to exploit since the first season is still very much present. Objectively, there are better shows out there. However, if you were in love with the first season, Season 3 will feel like a test. For me, it was passed successfully. There is no middle ground here. The relationship I have with the show might be a bit wobblier but that's just the end of the honeymoon phase. The love remains real. A show for the ages, there is no doubt about that.",Positive
10,"Awesome show!!! All the 80s you can handle and monsters, what's not to love! Hopper is a great flawed hero, he takes his lumps and keeps on fighting and Joyce is a headstrong out of the box thinking perfect counterpart to Hop. Everyone brings there own set of skills and flaws which ultimately make everyone very human and understandable/relatable. Great action, great humor, edge of your seat moments and heart tugs is what you get with this one... DON'T MISS IT!!!",Positive
10,After seeing this whole season. I have to say. This was the best Season yet. Glad I saw this one.,Positive
10,"I absolutely hate that Netflix is taking out all the cigarette smoking in the shows. Like what the hell in the 80s everyone used to smoke, it’s what put the show together. It’s relatable to some older people. Yes smoking is bad but honestly so many people are so sensitive now. Grow a pair and if you don’t like it then move tf on",Positive
9,"How a show gets better as it goes on is amazing to me. The season seems to culminate ideas from The Thing, Terminator and even Red Dawn. Overall a must-watch for the summer.",Positive
9,"Alot better than season 2, very nice, very good, very spicy and oh so nicey",Positive
9,"The best season so far, with an amazing attention to detail that is the perfect gestalt of a 80's action movie.",Positive
9,"Season three ratchets up all of the things about the show that we love. I think in furthering the character development, a few of our beloved characters get a little lost in the shuffle. I’m talking about you Jim Hopper! For the most part though, all of our terror and anxiety is amped up through the incredible work done by Dacre Montgomery as Billy. His sings with Millie Bobby Brown as Eleven are especially intense and at times heartfelt. Our supporting cast is there in ways that we haven’t seen before and we get new and interesting groups that are both funny and touching. This season doesn’t disappoint and only makes you want season for all the more.",Positive
8,"Excellent first season, Nice second season, Bad final season. It is an amazing sci-fi story, and you really start to care about the characters, but at the end, it fails to develop some characters and keep using some that aren't even relevant.",Positive
10,[SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.],Positive
8,"+Excellent cast +Great cinematography +Noticably larger production value -Screenplay and characters feel contrived this time around Dont get me wrong, S3 is a very enjoyable and high quality outing but a few **** points stopped it from achieving perfection this time around... EG:-why is Joyce so intensly motivated to solve the disturbances? Why is hopper now a great number of IQ points lower than previous outings?? The motivations of the characters just feel too convenient and inserts for the sake of 'team up 80's style' moments and the various odd almost sketch like setups.. I miss those natural, slower paced moments of S1. Nonetheless STS3 is one heck of a show to watch in 2019.",Positive
10,A classic nostalgic feel and expert character building Stranger Things is a brilliant show. It is amazing!,Positive
10,Amazing! Breathtaking! This may just be the best show on Netflix. Everything about the show is perfect. You must to watch it.,Positive
10,"Breathtaking! This may just be the best show on Netflix. Everything is fantastic. The show is set in the 1980's, and that works well with the plot devices and really makes the show possible. The characters on this show are very well fleshed out, and they all feel like real people, even minor characters that are only present in 1 or 2 scenes. The pacing on the show is also fantastic. The show only tells the viewer little bits of information, enough that they know what is going on, but not too much that it just gives away the answers. This keeps the show interesting. The acting is great too... You have to watch it!",Positive
10,"By far the best season. The characters emotions felt real, it was horrorfying in all the right ways. I came out of watching this season excited for season 4. The actors are phenomanal. Character Arcs from season 1 and 2 end in the best way possible. It felt like an extension of the series making ever so more powerful. I do wish we saw nancy be a bit more useful, otherwise great show, a definite must watch!",Positive
8,"Hawkins, Indiana faces a familiar but more lethal threat this time around as Soviet forces are attempting to bring back the alien life forms to use as weapons. Eleven, Mike, Will and the rest of the gang come together once again to get rid of this threat once and for all. Millie Bobby Brown is a STAR. I have said that before but I really believe it now. She has put a stamp on her future after three strong seasons of this series and I cannot wait to see what she does for the big screen (and hopefully she gets casted in better films than Godzilla: King of the Monsters). I don’t have to mention this but of course Winona Ryder and David Harbour provide great performances per usual but the surprise standout has to be Priah Ferguson who portrays Erica (Lucas’ little sister). She was sampled a little bit in season 2 and I guess the filmmakers answered our requests that she gets a lot more screen time. And I’m glad to say she becomes part of the main cast and she had me laughing after every line of dialogue. We all should come to know that Stranger Things always gives us great, clever writing with a really good suspense/thriller story. This season probably provides my favorite story as we finally move away from Will being the constant host of the “Demagorgons” and the stakes become much higher and grand. And as time in this series progresses, obviously our core cast of teens are aging. They aren’t kids anymore so there are some realistic aspects thrown in on some of them getting into their first relationship and others feeling left out and pushed to the side. Very relatable to us all whether we feel on either spectrum. Our main cast splits into four different story lines and I was invested into all of them for the most part. I will not lie that it took me a couple episodes to really get going into the story line that involves Chief Hopper and Joyce Byers. But as their story progresses, I couldn’t help but to love the outcome. This specific season most likely ends off on the most emotional note compared to the previous two. And that is not possible without the great writing and character development that the Duffer Brothers seem to give the main cast. And I absolutely adored the setting of this series as it takes place around and on July 4th. The set design and cinematography is so colorful and vibrant and the last two seasons do not match up to this third season as far as looks go. I have to sleep on this third season a bit before I say that it is my favorite but just the fact that I am thinking about it... definitely means you all will enjoy this new installment of Stranger Things. Happy binging!!!",Positive
9,"Best show on Netflix. Amazing characters, they are all built with a inusual kind of precision for a TVshow. The Seasons are always better and the story works very well in all the details. Something special with a perfect, young cast. Scare, fun and a little bit of drama make Stranger Things a masterpiece!",Positive
10,"Quite simply the greatest show of all time. Visuals are dazzling, characters are full, story is amazing, and it’s addictive AF.",Positive
10,"This might just be the best show on Netflix. Everything about the show is fantastic. The show is set in the 1980's, and that works well with the plot devices and really makes the show possible. The characters on this show are very well fleshed out, and they all feel like real people, even minor characters that are only present in 1 or 2 scenes. The pacing on the show is also fantastic. The show only tells the viewer little bits of information, enough that they know what is going on, but not too much that it just gives away the answers. This keeps the show interesting. The acting is great too. Every actor or actress is putting in a lot of effort, and that goes for both children and adults. If you are reading this review and have not yet checked out Stranger Things, you must.",Positive

Season 7-9: Personally, I found the less funny than previous seasons. Seemed writers keep the show go on longer than it's organic length. Feelgood ending of the entire show, so still worth to watch everything.",Positive

Michael Scott is truly one of the most memorable characters ever, but probably for some of the wrong reasons. The Dinner Party is one of my favorite episodes. It's a great example of how uniqe the Office is. No other episode of any TV show I've experienced has the level of hilariously awkward momdents that the Office has, especially in this episode. The best things about the Office are it's unique yet somewhat immature sense of humour, similar to that found in a 12 yo boy, it's extremely meaningful moments that will make you cry, and awkward moments that can be stressful to watch, but you become so wrapped up in the characters and the world that you can overlook these.

What an amazing 9 year journey - I feel like I really grew with this characters as they all matured and learned to seize their destiny, without ever losing their humorous and sarcastic selves in the process. Just like Dilbert and other ironic platforms, The Office pokes fun at corporate culture while imparting wisdom and warnings. The number of times the core crew reinvents themselves is quite heartening. I was worried in season 7 when a foundational character left, but the show carried on gracefully and ended on a nostalgic whimsical and harmonized wrap up in season 9. A truly perfect run, not a single season was dull or disengaged. And like many say, the series finale was emotional and resonant, beautifully wrapping up 9 years of themes.",Positive
10,"One of the best comedy shows of all time, if not THE best comedy show that I've ever laid eyes on. The first season may be hard to go through, but the later seasons make it worth it.

Angela's storyline in the final seasons is the only thing that stops it from possibly ruining the rest of the show.

10,"One of the best comedy series ever. I have rewatched it multiple times and still laugh out loud. The actors and the writers sometimes one in the same are all excellent. I highly recommend trying to make it through season 1, but stay for season 2, then it picks up steam.",Positive
9,"This show wasn't just funny. It was about a beautiful friendship and relationship with the people you care about. Jim and Pam will be everyone favorite couple, Dwight is a character that will never be forgotten in a million years because of Rain Willson outstanding comedy & performance.",Positive

10,"Do You Hate Your Boss? Michael Scott, played by Steve Carell, said, “Would I rather be feared or loved? Easy. Both. I want people to be afraid of how much they love me,” and everyone loved him. Even if he was making parkour videos in the parking lot or burning his foot on a George Foreman grill, everyone loved him, except for Toby maybe. The Office is a hilarious comedy with many heartfelt moments. Usually, the audience has a favorite character when watching a show. In this case, most people would say Michael is their favorite. However, many fans have other favorites. A poll from Cinema Blend, (****/sal86mf) ranks favorite characters. The top five spots go to Pam Beesly, Creed Bratton, Jim Halpert, Dwight Shrute, and number one, of course, Michael Scott. This show is perfect for teenagers and adults. This would not be recommended for children, as they would not understand the humor. The Office is available on Netflix, iTunes, Youtube and Amazon Prime. iTunes, Youtube, and Amazon Prime have The Office able to rent, which would be the best deal at around $1.99. Netflix would be the best option if the audience plans to watch other shows as well. Netflix has three subscription levels at $8.99, $12.99 and $15.99. The most expensive option would be buying the DVD’s for $49.99 off of Amazon. Though it is the most expensive streaming option, the DVD’s would last forever and it is a one time purchase This show deserves a 5 out of 5 stars because of the layout of the series. No matter the audience’s favorite character, each episode is different and focuses on a different character. This way, there isn’t a character who the whole series is about. It is spread evenly throughout the series. There are episodes where a certain character might not be as liked as other episodes. However, with every episode being different, every character is liked at some point. Therefore, everyone should watch The Office because it is different than any other show.",Positive
8,"The Office The Review The U.S. VERSION The Office is hands down one of the greatest shows to ever exist. Whether it is the great comedy from Michael Scott or the romance story between Pam and Jim. The Office has a place in anyone's heart! The Office is my favorite show. I personally love this show but I will try and look at this from another view with no bias to give it a proper review. The series itself goes on for nine seasons which means it has low points which will hurt its overall product. The first season of the show, in my opinion, was one of the worst seasons. First, the first season was only 6 episodes. Secondly, no one really loved the Michael character so they actually changed him quite a bit. Michael started out more mean in the beginning of the series but changed him to be more lighthearted. After season one the show really starts to hit its stride. From season two to season seven the show is at its prime. The episodes are well thought out and the comedy of the show is hilarious. Then... The main character Michael Scott played by Steve Carrell leaves the show towards the end of season seven. This tremendously hurt the show with viewers refusing to watch it. I believe the final two seasons weren’t that bad and actually added more to the story than the first seven seasons. The show did lose a lot of humor though which is really important for a comedy series. As much as I love this show I know the final seasons weren’t that great. If you wish to watch the show you can watch reruns on many TV stations. Also, if you have Netflix you watch the entire series. The monthly cost for Netflix starts at just $9. I would recommend this to most people honestly. I would say anyone over the age of 13 would love this show. “You should never settle for who you are.” -Michael Scott FINAL VERDICT: 8/10",Positive

Jim and Pam will be everyone favorite couple, Dwight is a character that will never be forgotten in a million years because of Rain Willson outstanding comedy & performance.",Positive

10,"Do You Hate Your Boss? Michael Scott, played by Steve Carell, said, “Would I rather be feared or loved? Easy. Both. I want people to be afraid of how much they love me,” and everyone loved him. Even if he was making parkour videos in the parking lot or burning his foot on a George Foreman grill, everyone loved him, except for Toby maybe. The Office is a hilarious comedy with many heartfelt moments. Usually, the audience has a favorite character when watching a show. In this case, most people would say Michael is their favorite. However, many fans have other favorites. A poll from Cinema Blend, (****/sal86mf) ranks favorite characters. The top five spots go to Pam Beesly, Creed Bratton, Jim Halpert, Dwight Shrute, and number one, of course, Michael Scott. This show is perfect for teenagers and adults. This would not be recommended for children, as they would not understand the humor. The Office is available on Netflix, iTunes, Youtube and Amazon Prime. iTunes, Youtube, and Amazon Prime have The Office able to rent, which would be the best deal at around $1.99. Netflix would be the best option if the audience plans to watch other shows as well. Netflix has three subscription levels at $8.99, $12.99 and $15.99. The most expensive option would be buying the DVD’s for $49.99 off of Amazon. Though it is the most expensive streaming option, the DVD’s would last forever and it is a one time purchase This show deserves a 5 out of 5 stars because of the layout of the series. No matter the audience’s favorite character, each episode is different and focuses on a different character. This way, there isn’t a character who the whole series is about. It is spread evenly throughout the series. There are episodes where a certain character might not be as liked as other episodes. However, with every episode being different, every character is liked at some point. Therefore, everyone should watch The Office because it is different than any other show.",Positive
8,"The Office The Review The U.S. VERSION The Office is hands down one of the greatest shows to ever exist. Whether it is the great comedy from Michael Scott or the romance story between Pam and Jim. The Office has a place in anyone's heart! The Office is my favorite show. I personally love this show but I will try and look at this from another view with no bias to give it a proper review. The series itself goes on for nine seasons which means it has low points which will hurt its overall product. The first season of the show, in my opinion, was one of the worst seasons. First, the first season was only 6 episodes. Secondly, no one really loved the Michael character so they actually changed him quite a bit. Michael started out more mean in the beginning of the series but changed him to be more lighthearted. After season one the show really starts to hit its stride. From season two to season seven the show is at its prime. The episodes are well thought out and the comedy of the show is hilarious. Then... The main character Michael Scott played by Steve Carrell leaves the show towards the end of season seven. This tremendously hurt the show with viewers refusing to watch it. I believe the final two seasons weren’t that bad and actually added more to the story than the first seven seasons. The show did lose a lot of humor though which is really important for a comedy series. As much as I love this show I know the final seasons weren’t that great. If you wish to watch the show you can watch reruns on many TV stations. Also, if you have Netflix you watch the entire series. The monthly cost for Netflix starts at just $9. I would recommend this to most people honestly. I would say anyone over the age of 13 would love this show. “You should never settle for who you are.” -Michael Scott FINAL VERDICT: 8/10",Positive
10,"The greatest comedy show of all time, fight me! This show has heart and non stop laughs, you rarely get that combo.",Positive
10,"Just finished up this wonderful series for the first time today (late to the party I know!). Truly heartwarming. The first season may be a shock as Michael is abrasive at first, but everyone grows on you. If you're a fan of Brooklyn 99, this show is for you too.",Positive

Michael Scott is truly one of the most memorable characters ever, but probably for some of the wrong reasons. The Dinner Party is one of my favorite episodes. It's a great example of how uniqe the Office is. No other episode of any TV show I've experienced has the level of hilariously awkward momdents that the Office has, especially in this episode. The best things about the Office are it's unique yet somewhat immature sense of humour, similar to that found in a 12 yo boy, it's extremely meaningful moments that will make you cry, and awkward moments that can be stressful to watch, but you become so wrapped up in the characters and the world that you can overlook these.

What an amazing 9 year journey - I feel like I really grew with this characters as they all matured and learned to seize their destiny, without ever losing their humorous and sarcastic selves in the process. Just like Dilbert and other ironic platforms, The Office pokes fun at corporate culture while imparting wisdom and warnings. The number of times the core crew reinvents themselves is quite heartening. I was worried in season 7 when a foundational character left, but the show carried on gracefully and ended on a nostalgic whimsical and harmonized wrap up in season 9. A truly perfect run, not a single season was dull or disengaged. And like many say, the series finale was emotional and resonant, beautifully wrapping up 9 years of themes.",Positive

10,"The Office is a truly spectaculer ride of emotions, but it's not too serious about it. Michael Scott is truly one of the most memorable characters ever, but probably for some of the wrong reasons. The Dinner Party is one of my favorite episodes. It's a great example of how uniqe the Office is. No other episode of any TV show I've experienced has the level of hilariously awkward momdents that the Office has, especially in this episode. The best things about the Office are it's unique yet somewhat immature sense of humour, similar to that found in a 12 yo boy, it's extremely meaningful moments that will make you cry, and awkward moments that can be stressful to watch, but you become so wrapped up in the characters and the world that you can overlook these. A truly spectacular show. And SlicK007 is dumb af",Positive

10,"I'm 7 years late, better late than never. What an amazing 9 year journey - I feel like I really grew with this characters as they all matured and learned to seize their destiny, without ever losing their humorous and sarcastic selves in the process. Just like Dilbert and other ironic platforms, The Office pokes fun at corporate culture while imparting wisdom and warnings. The number of times the core crew reinvents themselves is quite heartening. I was worried in season 7 when a foundational character left, but the show carried on gracefully and ended on a nostalgic whimsical and harmonized wrap up in season 9. A truly perfect run, not a single season was dull or disengaged. And like many say, the series finale was emotional and resonant, beautifully wrapping up 9 years of themes.",Positive
10,"One of the best comedy shows of all time, if not THE best comedy show that I've ever laid eyes on. The first season may be hard to go through, but the later seasons make it worth it. Even though the last few seasons weren't as great as season 2 or season 5, it's still worth it to finish the show.",Positive
10,"Some of my favorite characters ever between season 2 and 7, season 1 is good aswell but not as great as the rest and the final two unfortunately are truly mediocre. Angela's storyline in the final seasons is the only thing that stops it from possibly ruining the rest of the show. Infinite replayability. 10 may not be fair given what I said, but it is one of my favorite shows of all time.",Positive
10,Get past the first season and this will be a show you will watch on repeat again and again! Brilliant!,Positive
10,"One of the best comedy series ever. I have rewatched it multiple times and still laugh out loud. The actors and the writers sometimes one in the same are all excellent. I highly recommend trying to make it through season 1, but stay for season 2, then it picks up steam.",Positive
9,"This show wasn't just funny. It was about a beautiful friendship and relationship with the people you care about. Jim and Pam will be everyone favorite couple, Dwight is a character that will never be forgotten in a million years because of Rain Willson outstanding comedy & performance.",Positive

10,"Do You Hate Your Boss? Michael Scott, played by Steve Carell, said, “Would I rather be feared or loved? Easy. Both. I want people to be afraid of how much they love me,” and everyone loved him. Even if he was making parkour videos in the parking lot or burning his foot on a George Foreman grill, everyone loved him, except for Toby maybe. The Office is a hilarious comedy with many heartfelt moments. Usually, the audience has a favorite character when watching a show. In this case, most people would say Michael is their favorite. However, many fans have other favorites. A poll from Cinema Blend, (****/sal86mf) ranks favorite characters. The top five spots go to Pam Beesly, Creed Bratton, Jim Halpert, Dwight Shrute, and number one, of course, Michael Scott. This show is perfect for teenagers and adults. This would not be recommended for children, as they would not understand the humor. The Office is available on Netflix, iTunes, Youtube and Amazon Prime. iTunes, Youtube, and Amazon Prime have The Office able to rent, which would be the best deal at around $1.99. Netflix would be the best option if the audience plans to watch other shows as well. Netflix has three subscription levels at $8.99, $12.99 and $15.99. The most expensive option would be buying the DVD’s for $49.99 off of Amazon. Though it is the most expensive streaming option, the DVD’s would last forever and it is a one time purchase This show deserves a 5 out of 5 stars because of the layout of the series. No matter the audience’s favorite character, each episode is different and focuses on a different character. This way, there isn’t a character who the whole series is about. It is spread evenly throughout the series. There are episodes where a certain character might not be as liked as other episodes. However, with every episode being different, every character is liked at some point. Therefore, everyone should watch The Office because it is different than any other show.",Positive
8,"The Office The Review The U.S. VERSION The Office is hands down one of the greatest shows to ever exist. Whether it is the great comedy from Michael Scott or the romance story between Pam and Jim. The Office has a place in anyone's heart! The Office is my favorite show. I personally love this show but I will try and look at this from another view with no bias to give it a proper review. The series itself goes on for nine seasons which means it has low points which will hurt its overall product. The first season of the show, in my opinion, was one of the worst seasons. First, the first season was only 6 episodes. Secondly, no one really loved the Michael character so they actually changed him quite a bit. Michael started out more mean in the beginning of the series but changed him to be more lighthearted. After season one the show really starts to hit its stride. From season two to season seven the show is at its prime. The episodes are well thought out and the comedy of the show is hilarious. Then... The main character Michael Scott played by Steve Carrell leaves the show towards the end of season seven. This tremendously hurt the show with viewers refusing to watch it. I believe the final two seasons weren’t that bad and actually added more to the story than the first seven seasons. The show did lose a lot of humor though which is really important for a comedy series. As much as I love this show I know the final seasons weren’t that great. If you wish to watch the show you can watch reruns on many TV stations. Also, if you have Netflix you watch the entire series. The monthly cost for Netflix starts at just $9. I would recommend this to most people honestly. I would say anyone over the age of 13 would love this show. “You should never settle for who you are.” -Michael Scott FINAL VERDICT: 8/10",Positive
10,"The greatest comedy show of all time, fight me! This show has heart and non stop laughs, you rarely get that combo.",Positive
10,"Just finished up this wonderful series for the first time today (late to the party I know!). Truly heartwarming. The first season may be a shock as Michael is abrasive at first, but everyone grows on you. If you're a fan of Brooklyn 99, this show is for you too.",Positive
10,I haven't stopped watching this show since I was introduced to it. No notes.,Positive
8,"my comfort show. lots of humor that hasnt aged well, but the physical comedy is platinum grade. jim and pam have become more boring after every rewatch, but all the other characters have gotten more endearing and lovable. the show treats Meredith as gross and a punchline but she is the most bad-ass **** character on the show, change my mind.",Positive
10,"the best show in the entire world. if you want to watch television, it is an absolute crime if you don't watch this. the most renowned cinematographer in the entire world couldnt even begin to touch the depths of this amazing wonderful show. if you don't, you should be put in jail.

Lighter humor, still cringe moments, which are broken up by moments of humanity in each character. Satisfying character development. Season 7-9: Personally, I found the less funny than previous seasons. Seemed writers keep the show go on longer than it's organic length. Feelgood ending of the entire show, so still worth to watch everything.",Positive
10,A fun series all fans of comedy should at least try to watch. It's worth noting that the first season may be worth skipping due to it being very similar to the British 'The Office' which this was inspired by. Otherwise a mostly great show.,Positive

8,"The show sometimes dabbles in unintriguing side-storylines. While losing Michael was a decapating loss to the final 2 seasons, they still made up with fine comedy and heartfelt stories. The show overall is one for a generation. i never felt it was the greatest show I'd ever watched, but its a show that certainly carries its resonance. For some its a one-season and done experience.

Michael Scott is truly one of the most memorable characters ever, but probably for some of the wrong reasons. The Dinner Party is one of my favorite episodes. It's a great example of how uniqe the Office is. No other episode of any TV show I've experienced has the level of hilariously awkward momdents that the Office has, especially in this episode. The best things about the Office are it's unique yet somewhat immature sense of humour, similar to that found in a 12 yo boy, it's extremely meaningful moments that will make you cry, and awkward moments that can be stressful to watch, but you become so wrapped up in the characters and the world that you can overlook these.

What an amazing 9 year journey - I feel like I really grew with this characters as they all matured and learned to seize their destiny, without ever losing their humorous and sarcastic selves in the process. Just like Dilbert and other ironic platforms, The Office pokes fun at corporate culture while imparting wisdom and warnings. The number of times the core crew reinvents themselves is quite heartening. I was worried in season 7 when a foundational character left, but the show carried on gracefully and ended on a nostalgic whimsical and harmonized wrap up in season 9. A truly perfect run, not a single season was dull or disengaged. And like many say, the series finale was emotional and resonant, beautifully wrapping up 9 years of themes.",Positive
10,"One of the best comedy shows of all time, if not THE best comedy show that I've ever laid eyes on. The first season may be hard to go through, but the later seasons make it worth it.

Even if he was making parkour videos in the parking lot or burning his foot on a George Foreman grill, everyone loved him, except for Toby maybe. The Office is a hilarious comedy with many heartfelt moments. Usually, the audience has a favorite character when watching a show. In this case, most people would say Michael is their favorite. However, many fans have other favorites. A poll from Cinema Blend, (****/sal86mf) ranks favorite characters. The top five spots go to Pam Beesly, Creed Bratton, Jim Halpert, Dwight Shrute, and number one, of course, Michael Scott. This show is perfect for teenagers and adults. This would not be recommended for children, as they would not understand the humor. The Office is available on Netflix, iTunes, Youtube and Amazon Prime. iTunes, Youtube, and Amazon Prime have The Office able to rent, which would be the best deal at around $1.99. Netflix would be the best option if the audience plans to watch other shows as well. Netflix has three subscription levels at $8.99, $12.99 and $15.99. The most expensive option would be buying the DVD’s for $49.99 off of Amazon. Though it is the most expensive streaming option, the DVD’s would last forever and it is a one time purchase This show deserves a 5 out of 5 stars because of the layout of the series. No matter the audience’s favorite character, each episode is different and focuses on a different character. This way, there isn’t a character who the whole series is about. It is spread evenly throughout the series. There are episodes where a certain character might not be as liked as other episodes. However, with every episode being different, every character is liked at some point. Therefore, everyone should watch The Office because it is different than any other show.",Positive
8,"The Office The Review The U.S. VERSION The Office is hands down one of the greatest shows to ever exist. Whether it is the great comedy from Michael Scott or the romance story between Pam and Jim. The Office has a place in anyone's heart! The Office is my favorite show. I personally love this show but I will try and look at this from another view with no bias to give it a proper review. The series itself goes on for nine seasons which means it has low points which will hurt its overall product. The first season of the show, in my opinion, was one of the worst seasons. First, the first season was only 6 episodes. Secondly, no one really loved the Michael character so they actually changed him quite a bit. Michael started out more mean in the beginning of the series but changed him to be more lighthearted. After season one the show really starts to hit its stride. From season two to season seven the show is at its prime. The episodes are well thought out and the comedy of the show is hilarious. Then... The main character Michael Scott played by Steve Carrell leaves the show towards the end of season seven. This tremendously hurt the show with viewers refusing to watch it. I believe the final two seasons weren’t that bad and actually added more to the story than the first seven seasons. The show did lose a lot of humor though which is really important for a comedy series. As much as I love this show I know the final seasons weren’t that great. If you wish to watch the show you can watch reruns on many TV stations. Also, if you have Netflix you watch the entire series. The monthly cost for Netflix starts at just $9. I would recommend this to most people honestly. I would say anyone over the age of 13 would love this show. “You should never settle for who you are.” -Michael Scott FINAL VERDICT: 8/10",Positive

8,It's a fun series so far with a nice balance of action and investigation. A cop show without the limitations of the character being a cop,Positive
9,"Reacher is a thrilling crime drama that stays true to the essence of the Jack Reacher novels. Alan Ritchson delivers a commanding performance as Reacher, bringing both the physical intensity and sharp intellect of the character to life. The storyline is gripping, with well-paced mysteries and dynamic action sequences that keep viewers **** supporting cast and the chemistry among the characters add depth to the narrative, making the show more than just an action-packed series. However, some episodes lean on predictable storytelling, which slightly detracts from the overall experience. Despite this, Reacher succeeds in delivering a gritty and compelling adaptation that's sure to please fans of the **** you’re looking for a series with suspense, drama, and a strong lead, Reacher is definitely worth a watch. Let me know if you'd like this expanded or adjusted!",Positive
8,"I was ignoring this show since it started. Now that I watched it... well, it's really good. Of course there are some problems, but all in all loveable characters, good story and I love the pacing.",Positive
8,"Well made, with witty dialogues and interesting detective work. The story lines match and are thought through.",Positive
9,"I understand the Tom Cruise Reacher and Book Reacher are quite different in size and brutality but I enjoyed the movies. They were my 1st Reacher experience. Reacher the TV show, what am I in for? Well a hulk of a man that loves his freedom and traveling when and where he wants to go stumbles onto a small town that is covered in corruption and illegal activity. Reacher being Reacher fights his way to the top of the corruption with his friends Roscoe and Findlay setting the town free while his friends discover a little bit more about themselves and the inner strength. 2nd season, PLEASE HURRY!!!!",Positive
7,"Not a perfect series. But darn enjoyable. Episode 6/8 is the best of all the episodes. I like that they cast a large man (true to the books) instead of using a ""small child"" like Tom Cruise.",Positive

We'll leave Obama's ""Leave the World Behind"" to the woke they-thems. Yes, there are guns, fights and general mayhem on ""Reacher,"" but that is only half the fun. The interaction between Reacher's team is the real show. And it is quite enjoyable! Watch it!!!",Positive
9,"A good plot, simple and to the point with just enough curves and bumps to make it exciting. Alan Ritchson is on point and his acting is superb as the no-nonsense retired military officer Reacher. Action packed and gritty dialog leaves you rooting for the good guy like older action flicks.",Positive
10,"Season 1 of Reacher is loyal to its source material, smartly fresh for those familiar with it, and anchors itself with excellent casting. Alan Ritchson (and I'll say it till I'm blue in the face) embodies the titular character with affable confidence, heightening the brutality of the well-paced action which comes with its own crisp choreography. A dash of twists here, some bonding there, and Reacher joins a short list of properties that should be regarded as the templates for adapting something to small or big screens.",Positive
8,It made a good impression overall. I don't recall waiting for the next season of any TV show. This one is an exception.,Positive
8,This was the type of reacher the films deserved rather than a midget that did not resemble the source material in anyway shape of form. Can't wait for season two.,Positive
7,"Fun, for what it is. ""Dumb crime-action-thriller"" sort of pulp. Characters aren't very deep, but they are all likeable enough in the main cast - engaging action scenes, which is what you're watching for, generally speaking. Can't speak on how accurate an adaptation it is, but character seems more ""Book-accurate"" than the Cruise films, which are also enjoyable in their own way. Reacher in this is almost comically overpowered like he's the main character in his own video game universe.",Positive
9,"Fun, funny, and badass. Don't reinvent the wheel but knows how to entertain.",Positive
8,"This is just fun, loud and straightforward action/drama that streaming has been lacking. Is it life-changing, must-watch TV? Nope, but what really has been these days. It just puts a smile on my face to finish a series and say, ""That was cool. I like the characters, the action was great. Looking forward to more"". Best Reacher adaption by far, Ritchson is perfect, a slightly younger version of what I pictured while reading the novels. Looking forward to next season. I def recommend it.",Positive
10,"Alan Ritchson was phenomenal as the titular character, very much embodying the role he played. I loved the fight choreography of this series. Everyone involved did an amazing job.",Positive
7,"Started out way better than it finished, characters lost IQ , action became unrealistic at the end but still a very enjoyable watch",Positive
10,Nice to see show sticking to lee Child's work and not going woke route like all shows in this era.,Positive
8,[SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.],Positive
8,I'm very nostalgic about Jack Reacher and I'm happy they made a decent tv show about him. He's basically a gargantuan Sherlock Holmes who can murder people without batting an eye. (great casting choice for Jack's character). If you grew up with Jack Reacher you should definitely give the show a try. 8/10,Positive
9,This character has an undeniable presence! Amazon made a great casting decision. One point less than perfect because the plot felt formulaic at times - not as risky or daring as it could have been. Still - it was fun enough that I binged the entire series in less than two weeks. I wish they had more episodes coming out soon. Please Amazon - fast track this and get us 20 new episodes over the next year.,Positive
8,So far a decent show and I’m watching it…so I gave it an 8… but was Alan Ritchson deliberately written to have the emotional range of a carrot?,Positive
8,Violent and bloody. Jack Reacher is basically psychic superman/a boy named (Mary) Sue. He knows everything and there is never any real threat to him at any point. Silly plotting makes a lot of connections seem more coincidental than a mystery ...and riveting and fun.,Positive
9,"Reacher is a rare and refreshing thing these days, an oldschool action thriller series without an ounce of woke to it. I found it to be highly entertaining, intelligent with a great cast and well made. Definitely a lot better than the cruise movies Alan Ritchson is perfect for the role and I can't praise Willa Fitzgerald enough.",Positive
9,"Reacher S01 knocks it out of the park with the perfect adaptation of the book. If you are a fan of the book series, you are probably going to be much happier with this adaptation than the feature-length one. As for non-readers, it is a must-watch show, if you are interested in an action-packed crime mystery. Full Review: ****/post/reacher-s01",Positive
8,"It's big dumb fun, the show knows what it is doesn't try to be anything else. The casting is damn near perfect and every episode was enjoyable, but I will say the big final action piece was a bit of a let down and all the smoke and fire was distractingly mediocre CG.",Positive
10,"I did not have too high expectations because this is just an Amazon TV series. But, seriously, this is a good show. Recently there has been a deficit of straightforward protagonists with a firm ethical spine. The physicality of Reacher was also used without excess, and his childhood and military background were very clearly presented. The audience understands why he does what he does. The story is also pretty good.",Positive
10,Absolutely loving this series. Nearly perfect adaptation. Perfect cast. Good performances.,Positive
10,"Excellent adaptation of the books, the actors do a fantastic job portraying the different characters and the story. It's a extremely well executed series so far. Warmly recommended!",Positive
10,Everything you want in a Reacher show! This is probably the best adaption to ever make it to the screen. Must watch for any crime lover or reader of the Reacher series.,Positive
10,"I really enjoyed it, fun to watch and kept me intrigued all the way. Amazing characters",Positive
9,"Quite excellently done, and true to what I remember from the books. Some alterations for converting to series format, but well-executed and appropriate. An engrossing and thrilling ride.",Positive
10,Nearly perfect adaptation. The actor who plays Reacher is an excellent pick. Highly recommended to the book readers.,Positive
7,"This is a great action series. It doesn't take itself too seriously and I pretty much like everyone in it shout out to Willa Fitzgerald). I was hesitant because of the Cruise movies, which were bland, but pleasantly surprised.",Positive
10,Excellent. We'll done great show and highly recommend. Characters were great and well done all around.,Positive
10,"Hands down the best new show this year. Exceptional acting, dialog worthy of Sorkin and a solid story line. It has just enough humor to lighten a violence heavy storyline. A big endorsement of the person who did the casting as opposed to the nitwit who cast Tom Cruise as Reacher in the movies. If you can accept a high body count you’ll enjoy this show immensely.",Positive
10,"It's exactly what you think it would be. It's not life changing, it's not mind bending, it's a fun easy watch that keeps you hitting the next episode button. It doesn't try to be too clever, it doesn't try to be too cute, it delivers on what you are looking for, action, intrigue fun. Loved every episode!",Positive
8,"Starts a little twangy and by episode 4 it’s a blues band playing bangers. If you’re a fan of the books it will play much better than the movies, which were more like mission impossible retirement movies than pulpy novellas.

7,"Besides the wise talks sometimes and good fight scenes, there is nothing special in this one. Most of the time is boring, tbh.",Positive
8,It's a fun series so far with a nice balance of action and investigation. A cop show without the limitations of the character being a cop,Positive
9,"Reacher is a thrilling crime drama that stays true to the essence of the Jack Reacher novels. Alan Ritchson delivers a commanding performance as Reacher, bringing both the physical intensity and sharp intellect of the character to life. The storyline is gripping, with well-paced mysteries and dynamic action sequences that keep viewers **** supporting cast and the chemistry among the characters add depth to the narrative, making the show more than just an action-packed series. However, some episodes lean on predictable storytelling, which slightly detracts from the overall experience. Despite this, Reacher succeeds in delivering a gritty and compelling adaptation that's sure to please fans of the **** you’re looking for a series with suspense, drama, and a strong lead, Reacher is definitely worth a watch. Let me know if you'd like this expanded or adjusted!",Positive
8,"I was ignoring this show since it started. Now that I watched it... well, it's really good. Of course there are some problems, but all in all loveable characters, good story and I love the pacing.",Positive
8,"Well made, with witty dialogues and interesting detective work. The story lines match and are thought through.",Positive
9,"I understand the Tom Cruise Reacher and Book Reacher are quite different in size and brutality but I enjoyed the movies. They were my 1st Reacher experience. Reacher the TV show, what am I in for? Well a hulk of a man that loves his freedom and traveling when and where he wants to go stumbles onto a small town that is covered in corruption and illegal activity. Reacher being Reacher fights his way to the top of the corruption with his friends Roscoe and Findlay setting the town free while his friends discover a little bit more about themselves and the inner strength. 2nd season, PLEASE HURRY!!!!",Positive
7,"Not a perfect series. But darn enjoyable. Episode 6/8 is the best of all the episodes. I like that they cast a large man (true to the books) instead of using a ""small child"" like Tom Cruise.",Positive
10,"Good old fashion entertainment, well acted, fast paced (generally), intelligent, witty, acceptable overdoing of hero stuff. I think this is where the industry should look forward.",Positive
10,"You can watch Obama's jumbled drek on Netflix or you can watch ""Reacher"" on Amazon Prime. Real men (and women) watch ""Reacher."" We'll leave Obama's ""Leave the World Behind"" to the woke they-thems. Yes, there are guns, fights and general mayhem on ""Reacher,"" but that is only half the fun. The interaction between Reacher's team is the real show. And it is quite enjoyable! Watch it!!!",Positive
9,"A good plot, simple and to the point with just enough curves and bumps to make it exciting. Alan Ritchson is on point and his acting is superb as the no-nonsense retired military officer Reacher. Action packed and gritty dialog leaves you rooting for the good guy like older action flicks.",Positive
10,"Season 1 of Reacher is loyal to its source material, smartly fresh for those familiar with it, and anchors itself with excellent casting. Alan Ritchson (and I'll say it till I'm blue in the face) embodies the titular character with affable confidence, heightening the brutality of the well-paced action which comes with its own crisp choreography. A dash of twists here, some bonding there, and Reacher joins a short list of properties that should be regarded as the templates for adapting something to small or big screens.",Positive
8,It made a good impression overall. I don't recall waiting for the next season of any TV show. This one is an exception.,Positive
8,This was the type of reacher the films deserved rather than a midget that did not resemble the source material in anyway shape of form. Can't wait for season two.,Positive
7,"Fun, for what it is. ""Dumb crime-action-thriller"" sort of pulp. Characters aren't very deep, but they are all likeable enough in the main cast - engaging action scenes, which is what you're watching for, generally speaking. Can't speak on how accurate an adaptation it is, but character seems more ""Book-accurate"" than the Cruise films, which are also enjoyable in their own way. Reacher in this is almost comically overpowered like he's the main character in his own video game universe.",Positive
9,"Fun, funny, and badass. Don't reinvent the wheel but knows how to entertain.",Positive
8,"This is just fun, loud and straightforward action/drama that streaming has been lacking. Is it life-changing, must-watch TV? Nope, but what really has been these days. It just puts a smile on my face to finish a series and say, ""That was cool. I like the characters, the action was great. Looking forward to more"". Best Reacher adaption by far, Ritchson is perfect, a slightly younger version of what I pictured while reading the novels. Looking forward to next season. I def recommend it.",Positive
10,"Alan Ritchson was phenomenal as the titular character, very much embodying the role he played. I loved the fight choreography of this series. Everyone involved did an amazing job.",Positive
7,"Started out way better than it finished, characters lost IQ , action became unrealistic at the end but still a very enjoyable watch",Positive
10,Nice to see show sticking to lee Child's work and not going woke route like all shows in this era.,Positive
8,[SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.],Positive
8,I'm very nostalgic about Jack Reacher and I'm happy they made a decent tv show about him. He's basically a gargantuan Sherlock Holmes who can murder people without batting an eye. (great casting choice for Jack's character). If you grew up with Jack Reacher you should definitely give the show a try. 8/10,Positive
9,This character has an undeniable presence! Amazon made a great casting decision. One point less than perfect because the plot felt formulaic at times - not as risky or daring as it could have been. Still - it was fun enough that I binged the entire series in less than two weeks. I wish they had more episodes coming out soon. Please Amazon - fast track this and get us 20 new episodes over the next year.,Positive
8,So far a decent show and I’m watching it…so I gave it an 8… but was Alan Ritchson deliberately written to have the emotional range of a carrot?,Positive
8,Violent and bloody. Jack Reacher is basically psychic superman/a boy named (Mary) Sue. He knows everything and there is never any real threat to him at any point. Silly plotting makes a lot of connections seem more coincidental than a mystery ...and riveting and fun.,Positive
9,"Reacher is a rare and refreshing thing these days, an oldschool action thriller series without an ounce of woke to it. I found it to be highly entertaining, intelligent with a great cast and well made. Definitely a lot better than the cruise movies Alan Ritchson is perfect for the role and I can't praise Willa Fitzgerald enough.",Positive
9,"Reacher S01 knocks it out of the park with the perfect adaptation of the book. If you are a fan of the book series, you are probably going to be much happier with this adaptation than the feature-length one. As for non-readers, it is a must-watch show, if you are interested in an action-packed crime mystery. Full Review: ****/post/reacher-s01",Positive
8,"It's big dumb fun, the show knows what it is doesn't try to be anything else. The casting is damn near perfect and every episode was enjoyable, but I will say the big final action piece was a bit of a let down and all the smoke and fire was distractingly mediocre CG.",Positive
10,"I did not have too high expectations because this is just an Amazon TV series. But, seriously, this is a good show. Recently there has been a deficit of straightforward protagonists with a firm ethical spine. The physicality of Reacher was also used without excess, and his childhood and military background were very clearly presented. The audience understands why he does what he does. The story is also pretty good.",Positive
10,Absolutely loving this series. Nearly perfect adaptation. Perfect cast. Good performances.,Positive
10,"Excellent adaptation of the books, the actors do a fantastic job portraying the different characters and the story. It's a extremely well executed series so far. Warmly recommended!",Positive
10,Everything you want in a Reacher show! This is probably the best adaption to ever make it to the screen. Must watch for any crime lover or reader of the Reacher series.,Positive
10,"I really enjoyed it, fun to watch and kept me intrigued all the way. Amazing characters",Positive
9,"Quite excellently done, and true to what I remember from the books. Some alterations for converting to series format, but well-executed and appropriate. An engrossing and thrilling ride.",Positive
10,Nearly perfect adaptation. The actor who plays Reacher is an excellent pick. Highly recommended to the book readers.,Positive
7,"This is a great action series. It doesn't take itself too seriously and I pretty much like everyone in it shout out to Willa Fitzgerald). I was hesitant because of the Cruise movies, which were bland, but pleasantly surprised.",Positive
10,Excellent. We'll done great show and highly recommend. Characters were great and well done all around.,Positive
10,"Hands down the best new show this year. Exceptional acting, dialog worthy of Sorkin and a solid story line. It has just enough humor to lighten a violence heavy storyline. A big endorsement of the person who did the casting as opposed to the nitwit who cast Tom Cruise as Reacher in the movies. If you can accept a high body count you’ll enjoy this show immensely.",Positive
10,"It's exactly what you think it would be. It's not life changing, it's not mind bending, it's a fun easy watch that keeps you hitting the next episode button. It doesn't try to be too clever, it doesn't try to be too cute, it delivers on what you are looking for, action, intrigue fun. Loved every episode!",Positive
8,"Starts a little twangy and by episode 4 it’s a blues band playing bangers. If you’re a fan of the books it will play much better than the movies, which were more like mission impossible retirement movies than pulpy novellas. Listen, it doesn’t reinvent the wheel or scream must watch. What it does is give you some apple pie and a milkshake on a sunny fall day.",Positive

9,"I understand the Tom Cruise Reacher and Book Reacher are quite different in size and brutality but I enjoyed the movies. They were my 1st Reacher experience. Reacher the TV show, what am I in for? Well a hulk of a man that loves his freedom and traveling when and where he wants to go stumbles onto a small town that is covered in corruption and illegal activity. Reacher being Reacher fights his way to the top of the corruption with his friends Roscoe and Findlay setting the town free while his friends discover a little bit more about themselves and the inner strength. 2nd season, PLEASE HURRY!!!!",Positive
7,"Not a perfect series. But darn enjoyable. Episode 6/8 is the best of all the episodes. I like that they cast a large man (true to the books) instead of using a ""small child"" like Tom Cruise.",Positive
10,"Good old fashion entertainment, well acted, fast paced (generally), intelligent, witty, acceptable overdoing of hero stuff. I think this is where the industry should look forward.",Positive
10,"You can watch Obama's jumbled drek on Netflix or you can watch ""Reacher"" on Amazon Prime. Real men (and women) watch ""Reacher."" We'll leave Obama's ""Leave the World Behind"" to the woke they-thems. Yes, there are guns, fights and general mayhem on ""Reacher,"" but that is only half the fun. The interaction between Reacher's team is the real show. And it is quite enjoyable! Watch it!!!",Positive
9,"A good plot, simple and to the point with just enough curves and bumps to make it exciting. Alan Ritchson is on point and his acting is superb as the no-nonsense retired military officer Reacher. Action packed and gritty dialog leaves you rooting for the good guy like older action flicks.",Positive
10,"Season 1 of Reacher is loyal to its source material, smartly fresh for those familiar with it, and anchors itself with excellent casting. Alan Ritchson (and I'll say it till I'm blue in the face) embodies the titular character with affable confidence, heightening the brutality of the well-paced action which comes with its own crisp choreography. A dash of twists here, some bonding there, and Reacher joins a short list of properties that should be regarded as the templates for adapting something to small or big screens.",Positive
8,It made a good impression overall. I don't recall waiting for the next season of any TV show. This one is an exception.,Positive
8,This was the type of reacher the films deserved rather than a midget that did not resemble the source material in anyway shape of form. Can't wait for season two.,Positive
7,"Fun, for what it is. ""Dumb crime-action-thriller"" sort of pulp. Characters aren't very deep, but they are all likeable enough in the main cast - engaging action scenes, which is what you're watching for, generally speaking. Can't speak on how accurate an adaptation it is, but character seems more ""Book-accurate"" than the Cruise films, which are also enjoyable in their own way. Reacher in this is almost comically overpowered like he's the main character in his own video game universe.",Positive
9,"Fun, funny, and badass. Don't reinvent the wheel but knows how to entertain.",Positive
8,"This is just fun, loud and straightforward action/drama that streaming has been lacking. Is it life-changing, must-watch TV? Nope, but what really has been these days. It just puts a smile on my face to finish a series and say, ""That was cool. I like the characters, the action was great. Looking forward to more"". Best Reacher adaption by far, Ritchson is perfect, a slightly younger version of what I pictured while reading the novels. Looking forward to next season. I def recommend it.",Positive
10,"Alan Ritchson was phenomenal as the titular character, very much embodying the role he played. I loved the fight choreography of this series. Everyone involved did an amazing job.",Positive
7,"Started out way better than it finished, characters lost IQ , action became unrealistic at the end but still a very enjoyable watch",Positive
10,Nice to see show sticking to lee Child's work and not going woke route like all shows in this era.,Positive
8,[SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.],Positive
8,I'm very nostalgic about Jack Reacher and I'm happy they made a decent tv show about him. He's basically a gargantuan Sherlock Holmes who can murder people without batting an eye. (great casting choice for Jack's character). If you grew up with Jack Reacher you should definitely give the show a try. 8/10,Positive
9,This character has an undeniable presence! Amazon made a great casting decision. One point less than perfect because the plot felt formulaic at times - not as risky or daring as it could have been. Still - it was fun enough that I binged the entire series in less than two weeks. I wish they had more episodes coming out soon. Please Amazon - fast track this and get us 20 new episodes over the next year.,Positive
8,So far a decent show and I’m watching it…so I gave it an 8… but was Alan Ritchson deliberately written to have the emotional range of a carrot?,Positive
8,Violent and bloody. Jack Reacher is basically psychic superman/a boy named (Mary) Sue. He knows everything and there is never any real threat to him at any point. Silly plotting makes a lot of connections seem more coincidental than a mystery ...and riveting and fun.,Positive
9,"Reacher is a rare and refreshing thing these days, an oldschool action thriller series without an ounce of woke to it. I found it to be highly entertaining, intelligent with a great cast and well made. Definitely a lot better than the cruise movies Alan Ritchson is perfect for the role and I can't praise Willa Fitzgerald enough.",Positive
9,"Reacher S01 knocks it out of the park with the perfect adaptation of the book. If you are a fan of the book series, you are probably going to be much happier with this adaptation than the feature-length one. As for non-readers, it is a must-watch show, if you are interested in an action-packed crime mystery. Full Review: ****/post/reacher-s01",Positive
8,"It's big dumb fun, the show knows what it is doesn't try to be anything else. The casting is damn near perfect and every episode was enjoyable, but I will say the big final action piece was a bit of a let down and all the smoke and fire was distractingly mediocre CG.",Positive
10,"I did not have too high expectations because this is just an Amazon TV series. But, seriously, this is a good show. Recently there has been a deficit of straightforward protagonists with a firm ethical spine. The physicality of Reacher was also used without excess, and his childhood and military background were very clearly presented. The audience understands why he does what he does. The story is also pretty good.",Positive
10,Absolutely loving this series. Nearly perfect adaptation. Perfect cast. Good performances.,Positive
10,"Excellent adaptation of the books, the actors do a fantastic job portraying the different characters and the story. It's a extremely well executed series so far. Warmly recommended!",Positive
10,Everything you want in a Reacher show! This is probably the best adaption to ever make it to the screen. Must watch for any crime lover or reader of the Reacher series.,Positive
10,"I really enjoyed it, fun to watch and kept me intrigued all the way. Amazing characters",Positive
9,"Quite excellently done, and true to what I remember from the books. Some alterations for converting to series format, but well-executed and appropriate. An engrossing and thrilling ride.",Positive
10,Nearly perfect adaptation. The actor who plays Reacher is an excellent pick. Highly recommended to the book readers.,Positive
7,"This is a great action series. It doesn't take itself too seriously and I pretty much like everyone in it shout out to Willa Fitzgerald). I was hesitant because of the Cruise movies, which were bland, but pleasantly surprised.",Positive
10,Excellent. We'll done great show and highly recommend. Characters were great and well done all around.,Positive
10,"Hands down the best new show this year. Exceptional acting, dialog worthy of Sorkin and a solid story line. It has just enough humor to lighten a violence heavy storyline. A big endorsement of the person who did the casting as opposed to the nitwit who cast Tom Cruise as Reacher in the movies. If you can accept a high body count you’ll enjoy this show immensely.",Positive
10,"It's exactly what you think it would be. It's not life changing, it's not mind bending, it's a fun easy watch that keeps you hitting the next episode button. It doesn't try to be too clever, it doesn't try to be too cute, it delivers on what you are looking for, action, intrigue fun. Loved every episode!",Positive
8,"Starts a little twangy and by episode 4 it’s a blues band playing bangers. If you’re a fan of the books it will play much better than the movies, which were more like mission impossible retirement movies than pulpy novellas. Listen, it doesn’t reinvent the wheel or scream must watch. What it does is give you some apple pie and a milkshake on a sunny fall day.",Positive
10,"I don’t care if I lose my man card or not. Friends is one of the best shows of all time. Amazing main cast, great story lines, and plenty of humor without overdoing the punchlines like so many sitcoms do today.",Positive
10,"From a young age, my parents recommended this show to me as one of their childhood classics, and I was immediately hooked. The unique personalities between the main cast lead to some very interesting episodes and events happening, with the entire series feeling like a story of regular people finding love and success in their lives. Some jokes can be cheap and expected, but will still make you laugh because of the incredible delivery of the carefully selected actors. There are also many catchphrases that the characters will say which get you hooked and makes you feel a connection to them, whether it be Joey's ""how you doing?"" or Phoebe's ""oh no-"", it makes you feel like you're connected when you hear their phrases repeated and scattered across the show. Each series feels like a large build-up to a huge event at the end, whether it be the birth of a child, a marriage or a huge discovery, and they never disappoint. Looking back on it, I've never quite laughed and smiled at a piece of media as much as this one. An amazing show that should be cherished forever.",Positive
10,"Best show ever. After long time still touches the heart, makes me laugh and cry (sometimes both at the same time). Definitely my winner.",Positive
8,"""Friends"" has been my cozy escape, a world filled with laughter, love, and life lessons that resonate deeply. It's like catching up with old friends who never fail to make me smile, no matter how many times I revisit their stories.",Positive
8,"A comforting sitcom with likable characters and solid relationship dynamics. Comedy is decent. Story and certain jokes do falter in areas and don't land at times, but it's a classic for a reason.",Positive
10,Love this show that can make jokes that we can't make today. It's impressive how the show can keep the series interesting.,Positive
10,"The best sitcom of the 90's and 2000's, I just recently watched all the episodes back to back, just great! I love this show! The New York flat share with Rachel, Joey, Ross, Phoebe, Monica and Chandler, a top cast, just real friends, also in real life. Memories of my youth came back to me. Special mention should be made of the chameo performances by many stars. Sadly one is no longer with us. The amazing and talented Robin Williams, whom I admire very much. A great and incredibly talented actor of our modern times. Also, in New York there is now a ""Friends Experience"" (The Friends Experience, 130 E 23rd St, New York, NY 10010, United States), a must for all true fans of the series! Although the series was not filmed in New York. AWESOME! BRAVO, BRAVO, BRAVO!",Positive
10,"Indeed One of the Greatest sitcom! It was the most relatable sitcom,The 90s era was beautifully captured and on top of that as a sitcom it was funny as hell,It had the greatest ensemble of cameos ever in tv, The intro was catchy,It had most unique situations with the different kind of charcters and great actors, each character was on the league of their own, Monica like elder to all,rachel's like rich room-mate,ross was all nerd/brains,joey with little dumb and much fun,chandler as a sarcastic one and the unique of them all phoebe, individually they are awesome characters and the chemistry between the 6 was undescribable. The jaince was the most amazing fun/hateble character ever in sitcom,every apperance of her was a surprise, gunther and everyone's family members was good as side charcters and mike at last 2 season blends well with the 6, the story with all the plots ranging from starting to end of show and in between were brilliantly written, although the flasback sequence episodes were dull, the plot of ross and rachel was roller-coaster, and the last season really pulled a perfection it was the most satisfying end of the show.",Positive
10,"It has always been hard for me to find a show where I can just sit on the couch and laugh, cry, and feel all the emotions. Every other show seems to be too cheesy, or too sad, but Friends is the perfect match for them all. The TV show Friends has 10 seasons, and 236 episodes to offer this gives the opportunity for the viewers to feel as if they are really friends with this group of friends. The writers do a spectacular job of keeping the audience on their toes with a plot that is constantly changing. Another great thing about this tv show is how relatable it is. The characters go through various experiences that the viewers are able to relate to. Overall, if you are looking for a show that will leave your stomach hurt from laughing, and your eyes burning from crying this is the perfect show for you.",Positive
10,no words for F.R.I.E.N.D.S just best and well deserved although it will ruin your life after last episode :'),Positive

10,I think it was the best comedy movie that i have seen ever. So I suggest you to watch this movie. It's realy good movie. For example for me its story was amazing. The characters were wonderful. And I can say the best.,Positive
10,"There are some plot holes , but it's overall one of the best shows ever. Its entertaining , and it still gives me a chuckle , I always watch it or leave it in the background because it's apart of my life now.",Positive
9,"Friends is an excellent show. All of the actors are excellent and their comic timing is also perfect. It's great entertainment. Friends are talking and living their life, and you see what goes on. The writers have done best work. I have watched this show more than once. Only problem I saw in this show was after season 6/ 7, after which show's comedy content started becoming weak. Overall, I loved it and would recommend everyone to watch it.",Positive
10,"literally the best show ever made. anyone who says the contrary, u r tasteless.",Positive
10,"The best show. It is very funny and I hope that everyone will enjoy it, like I did.",Positive
10,"My Favorite series Forever and ever, I love all characters I love how they act.",Positive
10,"I have nothing against sit-coms in general, as long as they are funny. In America, there is Frasier and Will & Grace, in Britain, there is Only Fools and Horses and Last of the Summer Wine, they are great sit-coms. There was a time when I didn't like Friends very much, then again it was also at a time when I wasn't into sit-coms. My brother and sister, who absolutely adore the show suggested I should try the show again, so I did. Well, my initial reaction of the show was wrong, this show is great, it is funny and smart with appealing characters. It is by far one of the better American sit-coms and I do think it is better than Everybody Loves Raymond. First and foremost, I love the theme song. It may get on some people's nerves, but I find it irresistibly catchy, memorable and fun, with a simple melody and nice lyrics that are relevant. I also love how funny and smart Friends is. Some of the episode titles alone are hilarious and clever. That reminds me when I see and review When Harry Met Sally, maybe the title of the review should be ""The One With the Scene in the Diner"". Along with this the writing is consistently funny, with some wit and intelligence and very rarely becomes clichéd and cringe worthy. I even like the plot lines, I don't find them boring, predictable perhaps occasionally but the funny situations that the characters get into make them absorbing and worthwhile. The direction is also really solid, and the photography and scenery are striking. I love the characters, they are unique and engaging, even with their flaws they manage to be likable. Rachel does have moments when she is spoilt, but she is also the epitome of sweetness. I know there are people who have problems with Jennifer Aniston, the thing is I don't and I find her at her prettiest and most appealing here. Monica is another strong character, not the funniest by all means, but because she is almost like a maternal figure to the other characters with her caring and sympathetic attitude. I loved how Courtney Cox portrayed her. Phoebe is my favourite female character, she is hilarious; I especially love her songs, they are the sort of songs that are so bad they are great. Lisa Kudrow couldn't have been the more perfect choice for her, she pulls off Phoebe's personality to perfection. Joey is stupid admittedly, but I love him anyway because he is also cool. I am not a huge fan of Matt LeBlanc, but he is really good as Joey. Matthew Perry is great as Chandler, who is like a clownish and sarcastic sort of character, who makes jokes that are almost as bad as Phoebe's songs, but he is still a likable character in his own right. Ross is deliciously neurotic, I constantly love his priceless facial expressions and David Schwimmer's delivery is absolutely perfect. There have also been some wonderful guest stars, Elliot Gould as Jack Geller, Gary Oldman(who I really like in films like Dracula and Immortal Beloved) as Richard Crosby, Michael McKean and Danny DeVito as a stripper who arrives at a party in a policeman's outfit, all but to name a few. Overall, I love this show, not only for the writing but for the characters. 10/10 Bethany Cox",Positive
10,"The best show you will watch in life... comedy, drama, sensitive, all of it in one ... It is what you need to make life beautiful",Positive
10,this show is one of the best show in the world. every episode is funny and hilarious beside the story line is very good,Positive
10,I love friends so so much. Whenever I’m feeling sad I can always rely certain episodes to raise my mood and make me laugh. I feel so much better after watching it and a good laugh now and again feels amazing. I watched the whole series and I’m currently rewatching it. I feel friends is really relatable and I love some of the messages put across through it. What’s not to love. I would thoroughly recommend to everyone!! 10/10,Positive
9,"Friends is a great show. It's a show I grew up with my parents watching all the time, and I have seen all 10 seasons twice.

Looking back on it, I've never quite laughed and smiled at a piece of media as much as this one. An amazing show that should be cherished forever.",Positive
10,"Best show ever. After long time still touches the heart, makes me laugh and cry (sometimes both at the same time). Definitely my winner.",Positive
8,"""Friends"" has been my cozy escape, a world filled with laughter, love, and life lessons that resonate deeply. It's like catching up with old friends who never fail to make me smile, no matter how many times I revisit their stories.",Positive
8,"A comforting sitcom with likable characters and solid relationship dynamics. Comedy is decent. Story and certain jokes do falter in areas and don't land at times, but it's a classic for a reason.",Positive
10,Love this show that can make jokes that we can't make today. It's impressive how the show can keep the series interesting.,Positive
10,"The best sitcom of the 90's and 2000's, I just recently watched all the episodes back to back, just great! I love this show! The New York flat share with Rachel, Joey, Ross, Phoebe, Monica and Chandler, a top cast, just real friends, also in real life. Memories of my youth came back to me. Special mention should be made of the chameo performances by many stars. Sadly one is no longer with us. The amazing and talented Robin Williams, whom I admire very much. A great and incredibly talented actor of our modern times. Also, in New York there is now a ""Friends Experience"" (The Friends Experience, 130 E 23rd St, New York, NY 10010, United States), a must for all true fans of the series! Although the series was not filmed in New York. AWESOME! BRAVO, BRAVO, BRAVO!",Positive
10,"Indeed One of the Greatest sitcom! It was the most relatable sitcom,The 90s era was beautifully captured and on top of that as a sitcom it was funny as hell,It had the greatest ensemble of cameos ever in tv, The intro was catchy,It had most unique situations with the different kind of charcters and great actors, each character was on the league of their own, Monica like elder to all,rachel's like rich room-mate,ross was all nerd/brains,joey with little dumb and much fun,chandler as a sarcastic one and the unique of them all phoebe, individually they are awesome characters and the chemistry between the 6 was undescribable. The jaince was the most amazing fun/hateble character ever in sitcom,every apperance of her was a surprise, gunther and everyone's family members was good as side charcters and mike at last 2 season blends well with the 6, the story with all the plots ranging from starting to end of show and in between were brilliantly written, although the flasback sequence episodes were dull, the plot of ross and rachel was roller-coaster, and the last season really pulled a perfection it was the most satisfying end of the show.",Positive
10,"It has always been hard for me to find a show where I can just sit on the couch and laugh, cry, and feel all the emotions. Every other show seems to be too cheesy, or too sad, but Friends is the perfect match for them all. The TV show Friends has 10 seasons, and 236 episodes to offer this gives the opportunity for the viewers to feel as if they are really friends with this group of friends. The writers do a spectacular job of keeping the audience on their toes with a plot that is constantly changing. Another great thing about this tv show is how relatable it is. The characters go through various experiences that the viewers are able to relate to. Overall, if you are looking for a show that will leave your stomach hurt from laughing, and your eyes burning from crying this is the perfect show for you.",Positive
10,no words for F.R.I.E.N.D.S just best and well deserved although it will ruin your life after last episode :'),Positive

10,"This is absolutely my favorite TV show of all time, this series is a masterpiece, I can watch this anytime, no problem, it's very funny, it's very hilarious, and it has some iconic lines too. Best series ever and it never gets very old even you can't stop laughing.",Positive
10,I think it was the best comedy movie that i have seen ever. So I suggest you to watch this movie. It's realy good movie. For example for me its story was amazing. The characters were wonderful. And I can say the best.,Positive
10,"There are some plot holes , but it's overall one of the best shows ever. Its entertaining , and it still gives me a chuckle , I always watch it or leave it in the background because it's apart of my life now.",Positive
9,"Friends is an excellent show. All of the actors are excellent and their comic timing is also perfect. It's great entertainment. Friends are talking and living their life, and you see what goes on. The writers have done best work. I have watched this show more than once. Only problem I saw in this show was after season 6/ 7, after which show's comedy content started becoming weak. Overall, I loved it and would recommend everyone to watch it.",Positive
10,"literally the best show ever made. anyone who says the contrary, u r tasteless.",Positive

10,"I have nothing against sit-coms in general, as long as they are funny. In America, there is Frasier and Will & Grace, in Britain, there is Only Fools and Horses and Last of the Summer Wine, they are great sit-coms. There was a time when I didn't like Friends very much, then again it was also at a time when I wasn't into sit-coms. My brother and sister, who absolutely adore the show suggested I should try the show again, so I did. Well, my initial reaction of the show was wrong, this show is great, it is funny and smart with appealing characters. It is by far one of the better American sit-coms and I do think it is better than Everybody Loves Raymond. First and foremost, I love the theme song. It may get on some people's nerves, but I find it irresistibly catchy, memorable and fun, with a simple melody and nice lyrics that are relevant. I also love how funny and smart Friends is. Some of the episode titles alone are hilarious and clever. That reminds me when I see and review When Harry Met Sally, maybe the title of the review should be ""The One With the Scene in the Diner"". Along with this the writing is consistently funny, with some wit and intelligence and very rarely becomes clichéd and cringe worthy. I even like the plot lines, I don't find them boring, predictable perhaps occasionally but the funny situations that the characters get into make them absorbing and worthwhile. The direction is also really solid, and the photography and scenery are striking. I love the characters, they are unique and engaging, even with their flaws they manage to be likable. Rachel does have moments when she is spoilt, but she is also the epitome of sweetness. I know there are people who have problems with Jennifer Aniston, the thing is I don't and I find her at her prettiest and most appealing here. Monica is another strong character, not the funniest by all means, but because she is almost like a maternal figure to the other characters with her caring and sympathetic attitude. I loved how Courtney Cox portrayed her. Phoebe is my favourite female character, she is hilarious; I especially love her songs, they are the sort of songs that are so bad they are great. Lisa Kudrow couldn't have been the more perfect choice for her, she pulls off Phoebe's personality to perfection. Joey is stupid admittedly, but I love him anyway because he is also cool. I am not a huge fan of Matt LeBlanc, but he is really good as Joey. Matthew Perry is great as Chandler, who is like a clownish and sarcastic sort of character, who makes jokes that are almost as bad as Phoebe's songs, but he is still a likable character in his own right. Ross is deliciously neurotic, I constantly love his priceless facial expressions and David Schwimmer's delivery is absolutely perfect. There have also been some wonderful guest stars, Elliot Gould as Jack Geller, Gary Oldman(who I really like in films like Dracula and Immortal Beloved) as Richard Crosby, Michael McKean and Danny DeVito as a stripper who arrives at a party in a policeman's outfit, all but to name a few. Overall, I love this show, not only for the writing but for the characters. 10/10 Bethany Cox",Positive
10,"The best show you will watch in life... comedy, drama, sensitive, all of it in one ... It is what you need to make life beautiful",Positive
10,this show is one of the best show in the world. every episode is funny and hilarious beside the story line is very good,Positive
10,I love friends so so much. Whenever I’m feeling sad I can always rely certain episodes to raise my mood and make me laugh. I feel so much better after watching it and a good laugh now and again feels amazing. I watched the whole series and I’m currently rewatching it. I feel friends is really relatable and I love some of the messages put across through it. What’s not to love. I would thoroughly recommend to everyone!! 10/10,Positive
9,"Friends is a great show. It's a show I grew up with my parents watching all the time, and I have seen all 10 seasons twice. Good summary: An emotional but funny story about six best friends trying to have successful happy lives in New York City. Bad summary: Six straight white people whine about their relationships and betray each other before ultimately forgiving each other for dumb reasons.",Positive
10,"Could there BE a better show?! Friends 10 seasons of emotions, laughs and life. Definitely re-watching this for the 5th time!",Positive
10,100% best show I have ever seen it is absolutely amazing full of tear jerkers is a total emotional rollercoaster,Positive

10,"I don’t care if I lose my man card or not. Friends is one of the best shows of all time. Amazing main cast, great story lines, and plenty of humor without overdoing the punchlines like so many sitcoms do today.",Positive
10,"From a young age, my parents recommended this show to me as one of their childhood classics, and I was immediately hooked. The unique personalities between the main cast lead to some very interesting episodes and events happening, with the entire series feeling like a story of regular people finding love and success in their lives. Some jokes can be cheap and expected, but will still make you laugh because of the incredible delivery of the carefully selected actors. There are also many catchphrases that the characters will say which get you hooked and makes you feel a connection to them, whether it be Joey's ""how you doing?"" or Phoebe's ""oh no-"", it makes you feel like you're connected when you hear their phrases repeated and scattered across the show.

10,it was one of the best things that ever happened in my life and i just finished it so i wanna thank all the cast and producers for making those such great moments.i love guys.,Positive

5,Pretty decent TV show to watch. Season 2 and 3 were the lows of the show but it is an overall slightly above average TV show.,Mixed
6,"Overall a decent show. I loved the first two seasons and season three was alright, but I feel like season four dropped off a little. The plot was a little more messy and there was too much going on. However, my chief complaint about this show is that it is not at all epilepsy-friendly. There are an egregious amount of flashing lights that made portions of the show literally unwatchable.",Mixed
4,"Seasons 1 and 2 are great and make clever use of reference and homage, while maintaining their own identity. By the time Season 3 rolls around, there's plot recycling and homage is traded for straight up imitation. Season 4 seems to be more of the same there, in addition to some more ***pull plot elements. There's no way in my mind Season 5 could salvage this show after it jumped the shark hard in Season 3, so I give it 2/5 overall.

L walks through the **** her entrance wasn't even that great. Compared to other build up movie scenes it wasn't impressive...even when she entered the dance at the end it wasn't **** why get our hopes up and build our hearts up **** fighting to happen and for one creature to fly through the window? Never been so ghosted in a TV show... Yes episode 7 ****, I agree with most reviewers..fore the 80s punk scene here looked very, very poorly recreated UNLIKE the general 80s vibe and culture in the rest of the show...this should have felt more punk rock, instead it felt like a 2000's punk scene. The cinematography was very off. My GF said if they pulled out a cell phone it would have seemed **** I really hated the episode placement of this mostly because it was placed right before the finale episodes! Pulling me right out of the action...I was finally getting over some bad parts of the show and **** I have to get back into it on episode **** 8 had less affect. Very, annoying, sad, disappointing...THEN I GET EVEN MORE DISAPPOINTED BECAUSE THE BUILD UP FOR ACTION WAS WORTHLESS AND IM NOT EVEN AN ACTION MOVIE KIND OD GUY. Also I'm all for killing off characters but Bob gave the show some much needed lightness that the first season has, because the children felt so innocent, but the second season lacked. Killing off Bob was not helpful the show needs lightness. Lastly the script has always felt a bit **** copy and **** paralelle...I already have to get over that and how the show is a mash-up of Spielberg's **** then I have to deal with all this previously mentioned crap.

Until we saw the **** new black character was so stereotypical that a bunch of us had to leave the room out of anger. The worst being the sassy nurse at the Hospital. This is what happens when you have an all white writing staff writing black characters. Next the season was soooo all over the place with plot and story development. Lastly...Hopper's character has completely changed to reflect more of his Hellboy counter part in his new movie. I am with the squad on this one boo!!!,Mixed
5,"LONGTIME FAN AND LOVER OF THIS SHOW UNTIL...season 3 why do this? lol So first I want to say I love the new racial diversity but the new character Erica is so F***king annoying! Like I get it the girl is the typical 80s sassy Cosby kid archetype but why that one. Not only is it mildly offensive, and ignorant but really distracts and breaks the 4th wall boo I say. Second its like you wanted to do an 80s version of American horror story...which takes away from the whole magic of the show. It becomes less sci fi and more an IT meets knock off AHS. Its sad and breaks my heart that something so good can become so watered down in the span of one season.",Mixed
5,Pretty decent TV show to watch. Season 2 and 3 were the lows of the show but it is an overall slightly above average TV show.,Mixed
6,"Overall a decent show. I loved the first two seasons and season three was alright, but I feel like season four dropped off a little. The plot was a little more messy and there was too much going on. However, my chief complaint about this show is that it is not at all epilepsy-friendly. There are an egregious amount of flashing lights that made portions of the show literally unwatchable.",Mixed
4,"Seasons 1 and 2 are great and make clever use of reference and homage, while maintaining their own identity. By the time Season 3 rolls around, there's plot recycling and homage is traded for straight up imitation. Season 4 seems to be more of the same there, in addition to some more ***pull plot elements. There's no way in my mind Season 5 could salvage this show after it jumped the shark hard in Season 3, so I give it 2/5 overall. I don't know if the fame went to the directors' heads or Netflix simply wanted M0AR, whatever the cost, but it went downhill far earlier than I anticipated.",Mixed
5,"This season was tough. So many things to get over. The first season was a classic. The second season starts to show cracks and then has some big missteps. For me the worst part was this episode was the build up that went nowhere!!!! The build up in episode 8/9 was increasing my heart beat. I was on the edge of my seat for that like 20 or 30 sec. EXPECTED about 50 slimey/flower creatures to fly through the house causing an amazing fight... Biggest let down in an action scene ever....they could have used sound effects.....nooope....they could have shown L fighting more outside...they could have shot a HUGE action scene and closed the show in a classic way (they use so many fake tropes anyway) and ... L walks through the **** her entrance wasn't even that great. Compared to other build up movie scenes it wasn't impressive...even when she entered the dance at the end it wasn't **** why get our hopes up and build our hearts up **** fighting to happen and for one creature to fly through the window? Never been so ghosted in a TV show... Yes episode 7 ****, I agree with most reviewers..fore the 80s punk scene here looked very, very poorly recreated UNLIKE the general 80s vibe and culture in the rest of the show...this should have felt more punk rock, instead it felt like a 2000's punk scene. The cinematography was very off. My GF said if they pulled out a cell phone it would have seemed **** I really hated the episode placement of this mostly because it was placed right before the finale episodes! Pulling me right out of the action...I was finally getting over some bad parts of the show and **** I have to get back into it on episode **** 8 had less affect. Very, annoying, sad, disappointing...THEN I GET EVEN MORE DISAPPOINTED BECAUSE THE BUILD UP FOR ACTION WAS WORTHLESS AND IM NOT EVEN AN ACTION MOVIE KIND OD GUY. Also I'm all for killing off characters but Bob gave the show some much needed lightness that the first season has, because the children felt so innocent, but the second season lacked. Killing off Bob was not helpful the show needs lightness. Lastly the script has always felt a bit **** copy and **** paralelle...I already have to get over that and how the show is a mash-up of Spielberg's **** then I have to deal with all this previously mentioned crap. Oh and the UPSIDE DOWN **** IN SE02. THE UPSIDE USED TO BE SOOO VAST, instead it looks like only tunnels now.",Mixed
6,Stranger things started off so strong and great but now it does not feel as good anymore...netflix waited too long and now the characters look like 20-year-olds.,Mixed
5,"Hello, this is a default review because i'm forced to use 75 characters. I'll edit this review in the future talking about the game, don't worry ;) This is a general rating (Season 1 to Season 4) My final rate is: 5",Mixed
4,Extremely overrated .,Mixed
4,"Season 4 is the worst of all seasons! Even more drama, even more crying, even less ideas, too little humor and hardly any suspense. All in all, the series offers nothing more than a bit of 80s atmosphere and even that only sparsely: with a few interspersed songs and references to 80s movies, but that's about it. Mediocre at best and overrated.",Mixed
6,"While I can understand why people like this show, I think this kind of production is what makes the whole industry loose its soul. This show tries to have it all and have something for everyone. And yes, overall, it is a good show. But it doesn't have a corner. It doesn't have a point. It is nothing and everything.",Mixed
5,"Tries something in first season, but the other 2 seasons are boring, unnecessary",Mixed
6,"Stranger Things The Duffer Brothers are gushing out over 70s fantasy films in this splashy trend setting love letter to the now-teenagers and the ones back then. Ergo, the affection received by the fans comes flooding in, not for the razzle dazzle that this world thrives for but the accuracy it dares for. Before going in, on such a fiction world, it is often wisely and correctly, advised to dive in completely without being self-aware of the sketchiness involved in the- literal- topsy turvy world. Yet, consistently the Duffer Brothers are defying the evergreen rule in order to push the series for more than a cultural phenomenon. They wish for the series to hold against time and as a result, this banal obsession leads them to some of the best aspects of the storytelling. Yes, it every now and then fumbles to conjure up, not courage, but reason to walk out of the door slamming it hard on its audience, but these minor flaws are easily overcome by the frivolity in these characters. The outdo-ers are not the ground breakers but ground covering humanoid elements. For instance, let's just walk through their bulletproof armor Eleven played magnanimously by Millie Bobby Brown. She is the right and wrong of the series, the world revolves around her, everything is in contrast to her, no matter how hard the makers try to make it about someone else, it always pins down to her. And hence, she isn't taken for granted in here, she is tested, time after time, her ballet dance at the end of the act is not the win, but her fear of the stage and the audience around it, choreographs it elegantly. On supporting cast, David Harbour, as a father figure, draws you naturally, to what I consider has some of the best equation and scenes with Bobby Brown, than she has with Stranger Things.",Mixed
6,"3 season of Stranger Things already not so impress as the first two. Already there is a feeling that screenwriters have nothing to surprise. Therefore there are spiteful comical Russians who speak Russian grotesquely. I know as Netflix treats historicity. How to me it is ridiculous to Russian to look at it, looking at all this there is a wish to tell, but whether the series genre was replaced with a sitcom? And even if to reject all this, then the crumpled and boring work turns out. The final so in general remained open, probably plan the 4th season. But why, if 3 already such boring? Why to ruin good series in which 1 season was magnificent.",Mixed

6,"This season really suffered for multiple reasons. The main one being that the writers simply had no idea where to take the show after four successful seasons and ended up spinning wildly out of control with contrived plots, useless twists and characters that go nowhere. Chief among them, Ed Helms as Andy, who has never been that good to begin with but is now intolerable to watch. They have **** all the life out of Jim and Pam's relationship. Michael is an empty shell. Ryan keeps popping up for no reason at all, other than B.J. Novak appears to write himself back into the script from time to time. The show has long suffered from too many characters. Introducing Idris Elba didn't help either, nor did throwing in Erin as the new receptionist while Michael tries to start up a paper company of his own, inexplicably managing to lure Pam away from the office. There are still quite a few good laughs, but even Dwight seems unsure where all this is going. The confidence that had previously sustained him is gone, as he tries to figure out how to appeal to the temporary branch manager in Charles Minor. I don't even know why Idris Elba would take on a role like this. It doesn't suit him at all, and he only sticks around for a handful of episodes. Definitely a season to skip over.",Mixed

His action partner and love interest, Roscoe, is ridiculously petite, more like his kid sister than a romantic peer. The casting in general is a dumpster fire.

And somehow they keep state and fed law enforcement out of the picture even though his brother, a Secret Service agent was murdered. Ridiculous.

6,"Lee Child has made his name as the author of 25 crime novels featuring the titular hero, a retired Military Police Officer with a violent streak and a gargantuan frame (6'5"", 250 lbs of mighty muscle). Tom Cruise made 2 movies as the character, but he didn't possess the stature, physical or otherwise, to carry off the role (my reviews of  Jack Reacher and Never Go Back). Alan Ritchson certainly fits the physical bill and they make a point of proving it by baring his torso at least once in every episode. As for performance, he's got the steely demeanor down (with occasional mild smirk or wise ass comment) and there's no question he can kick ass. In this adaptation of Child's first novel The Killing Floor, Reacher finds himself in a small Georgia town where murders begin to pile up. Toss in lots of shady characters and you have a fairly typical crime drama plot. When Reacher does get physical, he dispatches his enemies with quick violent strokes (also at least once every episode). Fans of the novels will probably find Ritchson more to their liking. He's certainly imposing and sometimes allows a bit of personality to break thru the rigid disposition. However, the rather average production and pedestrian writing make this a pretty standard by-the-numbers procedural. [usr =3.0]",Mixed

6,"Lee Child has made his name as the author of 25 crime novels featuring the titular hero, a retired Military Police Officer with a violent streak and a gargantuan frame (6'5"", 250 lbs of mighty muscle). Tom Cruise made 2 movies as the character, but he didn't possess the stature, physical or otherwise, to carry off the role (my reviews of  Jack Reacher and Never Go Back). Alan Ritchson certainly fits the physical bill and they make a point of proving it by baring his torso at least once in every episode. As for performance, he's got the steely demeanor down (with occasional mild smirk or wise ass comment) and there's no question he can kick ass. In this adaptation of Child's first novel The Killing Floor, Reacher finds himself in a small Georgia town where murders begin to pile up. Toss in lots of shady characters and you have a fairly typical crime drama plot. When Reacher does get physical, he dispatches his enemies with quick violent strokes (also at least once every episode). Fans of the novels will probably find Ritchson more to their liking. He's certainly imposing and sometimes allows a bit of personality to break thru the rigid disposition. However, the rather average production and pedestrian writing make this a pretty standard by-the-numbers procedural. [usr =3.0]",Mixed

6,"""Reacher (S01, 8 eps, 45+ mins, Amazon) is a pretty decent action/murder-mystery but it should've been great, instead it has a set of problem points. And that starts with our title lead Alan Ritchson. He's definitely the right size/bulk but his clean cut appearance is at odds with the ""wild man"" he should appear to be. He looks more like one of those bulked up clean cut agents from the Matrix series. He's more accountant than military. His walk, his gait is kind of sissy-ish. Joel Kinnaman or Jason Momoa would've been SOOOOO much better and more convincing in this very important role. His action partner and love interest, Roscoe, is ridiculously petite, more like his kid sister than a romantic peer. The casting in general is a dumpster fire. And the action sequences where people die or get maimed are always unwitnessed by anyone, just so implausible. And somehow they keep state and fed law enforcement out of the picture even though his brother, a Secret Service agent was murdered. Ridiculous. That small town would've doubled its size in law enforcement presence within the day. So yeh, it's a disappointing action fantasy when you suspend so many elements of reality.

0,"This is a review for season 4. I hated season 2. It's clear that the show wasn't meant to continue past season 1 in this way. It was meant for an anthology. I skipped season 3 and watched season 4. I had fun for what it was but I can't help but feel like the standards for good writing have plummetted. Another show came out in 2006 which bore a lot of similarities. Pitching a seasonal anthology format deconstructing a pulp genre with a fantastic, self contained first season. As soon as season 2 hit, everyone turned on it. The writing quality clearly dipped and season 4 did regain some ground but it was too little too late. If that show came out now, people would probably be way more forgiving of it and they absolutely should not be. That show was called Heroes. Stranger Things went down the same trajectory and yet people are letting it slide. Is it nostalgia? Have viewers become so plaquated that they ring the pavlovian bell, for the sake of recognizing something they like? It's all icing and no cake. The amount of contrivances, contorted character actions, poorly set up plot points, dropped subplots, hamfisted themes, terrible moments of dialogue, jarring tonal shifts, deflated payoffs, and retreaded narrative/character beats is honestly embarassing. I would be ashamed if I wrote this. But for some reason people are loving it. This show is poisoning pop culture with this 80s incest. I really enjoyed it on an ironic schlock level, but I feel like the odd one out. Eleven has the exact **** SAME character arc as in season 1. How is this acceptable???  If you are an asipiring writer, just keep in mind that no matter how much your professors jump down your throat for the simplest mistakes, or moments of growth and learning while you write, people were paid to write this show and it got approved.

0,"This is a review for season 4. I hated season 2. It's clear that the show wasn't meant to continue past season 1 in this way. It was meant for an anthology. I skipped season 3 and watched season 4. I had fun for what it was but I can't help but feel like the standards for good writing have plummetted. Another show came out in 2006 which bore a lot of similarities. Pitching a seasonal anthology format deconstructing a pulp genre with a fantastic, self contained first season. As soon as season 2 hit, everyone turned on it. The writing quality clearly dipped and season 4 did regain some ground but it was too little too late. If that show came out now, people would probably be way more forgiving of it and they absolutely should not be. That show was called Heroes. Stranger Things went down the same trajectory and yet people are letting it slide. Is it nostalgia? Have viewers become so plaquated that they ring the pavlovian bell, for the sake of recognizing something they like? It's all icing and no cake. The amount of contrivances, contorted character actions, poorly set up plot points, dropped subplots, hamfisted themes, terrible moments of dialogue, jarring tonal shifts, deflated payoffs, and retreaded narrative/character beats is honestly embarassing. I would be ashamed if I wrote this. But for some reason people are loving it. This show is poisoning pop culture with this 80s incest. I really enjoyed it on an ironic schlock level, but I feel like the odd one out. Eleven has the exact **** SAME character arc as in season 1. How is this acceptable???  If you are an asipiring writer, just keep in mind that no matter how much your professors jump down your throat for the simplest mistakes, or moments of growth and learning while you write, people were paid to write this show and it got approved.

You won't find any Navy SEALS built like Hulk Hogan, waxed down, looking like they spend 4 hours a day bodybuilding in the gym. No, they tend to be smaller, leaner, quicker, more lethal. This Reacher also gets beaten up a lot by guys half his size. He's a pretty terrible fighter. Should spend less time bodybuilding and more time on the mat.",Negative
3,"Starts out good with the main character being very imposing and looking like an actual Reacher. By episode four, however, it turns to woke nonsense with a lecture about white privilege, racism, and so forth. We really don't need more of this.",Negative
2,"This is CW quality. The final episodes were cheesy 80's B-movie quality. I understand why it's getting good audience reviews - people are longing for traditional masculinity to be heroic again, instead of ""toxic masculinity"" pervading every woke show and movie.

0,"I loved the show when it aired out initially, and rewatching the show I find that it was incredibly misandrist. The men are more often than not the butt of the joke when they are not simply portrayed as buffoons, simps, simpleton bros, abusive (rachel's dad, or her ex husband), stupid nerds without any real desires with value (unless they simp for the right woman). The women on the other hand are on a pedestal of its own. They are ambitious, creative, insightful, clever, emotionally intelligent, capable of overcoming adversity, better than men in each and every aspect. For example, there is an episode involving Ross's kid choice between a GI joe and a barbie and of this episode there is a 3-5 minutes reminder by monica in front of ross's ex wife how he crossdressed. Who in their right mind would spill private and embarrassing information like that in front of parties who do nothing but enjoy using this information to humiliate another? This doesn't strike me as having anything of value but to demonstrate that it's fine to have no respect for someone else's private life in front of obviously adversarial parties. As I mentioned, I'm viewing this show again now and even if some of the jokes still work well, the obvious unbalanced treatment of the characters is very disturbing.",Negative

0,How can a show be so unfunny and so popular and so loved. A lot of people say Friends is the best comedy show ever and there's no way those people watched any other comedy show in their life and if they did they only watched young sheldon. This show is incredibly unfunny none of the jokes land and somehow its still filled with canned laughter everywhere.,Negative
0,Bad and predictable jokes and story with no attention to details and small things i wish it wasnt so predictable,Negative
2,"I've watched friends twice now and I can conclude that I have wasted a lot of time, I was a fool to watch this show twice. Its unrealistic, unnatural and filled with bad jokes. The humor in this show is just an illusion of comedy. If you look back at all your favorite jokes in fact all jokes, they are just a lazy attempt to bring joy to the viewer and it fails in that so the 'laugh tracks' literally tell you when to laugh. It feels like the show just cant come up with good jokes and to cover them up they came up with laugh tracks, remove these laugh tracks and listen to the jokes and you will realize how bad they actually are. Overall friends is a pathetic excuse of a funny TV show, boring plot, unrealistic events, annoying characters.",Negative
